    "text": "Wu, F., Zhao, Y., Wu, J. et al. De novo design of epitope-specific antibodies via a structure-driven computational workflow. Nat Commun (Unknown 2025ca), 625 (2026). https://doi.org/10.1038/s []-[]\n\nAccurate modeling of antibody-antigen complex structures holds significant potential for advancing biomedical research and the design of therapeutic antibodies. Compared to general proteins, progress in antibody structure prediction and design has been slow, and antibody discovery is still based on time-consuming animal immunization or library screening methods. Here, we present tFold System, a high-throughput computational workflow that integrates antibody structure prediction (tFold-Ab), antibody-antigen complex modeling (tFold-Ag), structure-guided virtual screening, and de novo epitopespecific antibody design. Using this system, we de novo design monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against four therapeutically relevant antigens: influenza hemagglutinin (Flu A), PD-1, PD-L1, and SARS-CoV-2 RBD (SC2RBD). Experimental validation by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) following highthroughput screening via phage display shows the designed antibodies achieve nanomolar binding affinities and precise epitope targeting, demonstrating the efficiency of the integrated computational-experimental pipeline. Our results demonstrate that tFold System overcomes key limitations of existing methods by enabling rapid, high-throughput antibody discovery against user-defined epitopes.\nAntibodies, produced by clonal B cells, play a crucial role in the human adaptive immune system by specifically recognizing and responding to foreign molecules or antigens (Unknown 2025a). As a leading class of therapeutic proteins, the antibody market is projected to exceed $445 billion by 2028 (Unknown 2025dh). Despite the significant interest of the pharmaceutical industry in therapeutic antibodies, their development still largely relies on traditional methods such as animal immunization and display-based selection (including phage and yeast display) to identify candidate molecules that bind to specific targets (Unknown 2025ds). These approaches are often cumbersome and time-consuming and may not produce antibodies that interact effectively with particular antigen epitopes (Unknown 2025ed).\nRecent advances in high-throughput B cell sequencing have generated a large amount of data essential to investigate the complex mechanisms underlying the adaptive immune response, paving the way for data-driven antibody research (Unknown 2025eo). In recent years, computational methods for antibody design have rapidly evolved (Unknown 2025ey, 2025fj), including techniques such as complementarity-determining regions (CDR) grafting to enhance affinities (Unknown 2025fu, 2025gf, 2025b, 2025m), energy-based sequence design to optimize interacting regions (Unknown 2025x, 2025ai, 2025at), antibody inverse folding (Unknown 2025be, 2025bp, 2025ca) and PLM-based mutations for binding affinity optimization (Unknown 2025cl, 2025cw, 2025di, 2025dj). However, progress in the realm of de novo antibody design has been relatively slow. While the RFantibody (Unknown 2025dk) (RFdiffusion specialized for antibody design) has\ndemonstrated potential, it primarily validated the design capabilities for some scFvs and VHHs, which exhibited relatively low affinity.\nAn ideal antibody de novo design should be capable of targeting specific epitopes of any antigen sequence. Given a framework region (FR)—most often a human framework—it should enable the design of CDRs while maintaining the integrity of the FR, thereby generating high-affinity, functional, developable, and epitope-specific antibodies. The entire process can be broken down into four components: CDRs recovery, antibody prediction, antibody–antigen complex prediction and virtual screening of antibodies, each of which presents significant difficulties that contribute to the overall challenge.\nThe challenges associated with de novo antibody design primarily stem from two factors: data scarcity and the structure of antibody–antigen interactions. There is a relative lack of experimental structures for antibodies, with approximately 9000 structures available in SAbDab (Unknown 2025dl) compared to 230,000 general structures in the PDB. This disparity complicates the training of AI models and increases the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the interface between antibodies and antigens is predominantly composed of disordered loops and betasheets, rather than the more straightforward alpha-helical structures commonly found in binder design. Predicting the structures of antibody-antigen complexes presents further challenges. While recent de novo protein binder design methods, such as RFDiffusion (Unknown 2025dm), BindCraft (Unknown 2025dn), and AlphaProteo (Unknown 2025do), have demonstrated high success rates, they are supported by robust protein structure prediction techniques like RoseTTAFold (Unknown 2025dp), AlphaFold-Multimer (Unknown 2025dq), and AlphaFold-(Unknown 2025ds, 2025dr). However, in the field of antibodies, the performance of AlphaFold-Multimer has not been satisfactory (Unknown 2025dt). Although AlphaFold-3 has achieved significant improvements, it requires extensive sampling and relies on multiple sequence alignments (MSA) as input, necessitating lengthy searches for homologous sequences. These factors collectively hinder the advancement of effective de novo antibody design.\nIn this work, we present the tFold system, a computational workflow for the rapid and accurate modeling and design of antibody–antigen complexes, capable of de novo designing high-affinity, functional, developable, and epitope-specific antibodies. Equipped with a pre-trained large protein sequence model (ESM-PPI) and transformer-based structure prediction modules, the tFold system enables efficient end-to-end atomic-resolution predictions of antibody structures (tFold-Ab) and antibody-antigen complexes (tFold-Ag) directly from their sequences. Our in silico tests demonstrate the capabilities of the components of the tFold system for structureguided virtual screening of binding antibodies, and for the co-design of structure and sequence for epitope-specific antibodies. Utilizing this system, we successfully design mAbs targeting specific epitopes for four distinct antigens: Flu A, PD-1, PD-L1, and the SC2RBD. SPR experiments confirm that our designed antibodies exhibit nanomolar affinities (3.22 nM for Flu A, 81.6 nM for PD-1, 0.045 nM for PD-L1 and \\(2 . 0 \\mathsf { n M }\\) for SC2RBD) and precise epitope targeting—as evidenced by competitive binding assays. Integration of computational design with high-throughput experimental screening highlights the potential of the tFold system to streamline the early development process of antibody therapeutics and address previously challenging targets in the field.\n\nResults\nIn this section, we first describe the methodological framework of the tFold system and present experimental validation across four distinct therapeutic targets. We then delineate four key challenges addressed by our design solutions with in silico evaluation:\n\nAntibody/nanobody structure prediction (tFold-Ab),\n\nAntibody–antigen complex prediction (tFold-Ag),\n\nStructure-guided virtual screening of binding antibodies, and (Unknown 2025ed). Joint antibody structure prediction and sequence recovery.\n\n\n\ntFold system for de novo antibody design\nThe tFold system is a computational workflow designed to address key challenges in de novo antibody design. By combining sequence-based generative modeling with structure-aware filtering, it enables end-toend antibody generation, with its workflow illustrated in Fig. 1a.\nFrom a functional perspective, the tFold system operates by accepting three inputs: antigen sequence, specified epitopes and known antibody FR templates. It dynamically “fills in” the unknown portions of the CDRs while co-predicting antibody-antigen complex structures. Iterative refinement occurs through confidence scoring (ipLDDT), where low-scoring designs undergo masked region recycling until viable sequences emerge. Ultimately, this process outputs FR-specific antibodies with precise epitope targeting.\nThe implementation involves two core modules: (1) a generator that produces a large number of candidate antibodies through random seed sampling, along with corresponding structure predictions, which are generated by our developed tFold-Ag-ppi when provided with an antigen epitope; and (2) a filter that performs structure-guided virtual screening. The generator generates antibody sequences that can effectively bind to specific epitopes of the antigen and predicts their corresponding antibody-antigen complexes, primarily driven by our developed tFold-Ab and tFold-Ag. The filter assigns a score that correlates with the experimental viability of the complex; candidates with higher scores are considered experimentally viable, while those below a certain threshold are filtered out, led by the structural prediction software tFold-Ag and AlphaFold-Multimer.\nTo experimentally validate the tFold system design performance, we designed antibodies against four targets: Flu A, PD-1, PD-L1, and SC2RBD. Selection criteria balanced viral pathogenesis relevance (Flu A, SC2RBD) and therapeutic importance (PD-1, PD-L1). A humanized FR (human germline: IGHV3-23/IGKV1-5) was chosen for its advantages in stability, expression yield, and aggregation resistance (Unknown 2025du) 32,. Design parameters incorporated V-J pairing frequencies and CDR3 length distributions from the observed antibody space (OAS)(Unknown 2025dw), with fixed J genes (IGHJ4/IGKJ1) and (Unknown 2025dz) CDR3 length combinations (Table (Unknown 2025a)). We generated a large pool of candidate antibodies, which were subsequently filtered to produce (Unknown 2025b),000 Fab pairs per target for synthesis. Novelty was enforced through sequence divergence thresholds.\nAfter the candidate antibodies were designed using the tFold system, they underwent experimental validation. Given the low success rate associated with antibody design, we employed a two-phase experimental pipeline (Fig. 1b). The binder identification phase constructed phage display libraries, followed by biopanning—using sequential solid-phase and liquid-phase selection to isolate binding clones. Successful candidates advanced to the binder characterization phase, where monoclonal antibodies underwent production, purification, and functional evaluation. SPR quantified binding affinities, and competition assays verified functional epitope specificity.\n\n\ntFold system can design high affinity antibodies\nBinding affinity \\(( K _ { D }\\) values) serves as a critical metric for evaluating KDantibody–antigen interaction strength, reflecting binding tightness. Antibodies derived from natural libraries typically exhibit nanomolar affinities (Unknown 2025dx) while FDA-approved therapeutic antibodies often achieve low-picomolar \\(K _ { \\mathrm { D } }\\) values through multiple rounds of experimental Kaffinity maturation (Unknown 2025dy) 36,.\nWe produced ten Fc-fusion antibodies selected through the binder identification pipeline, each containing distinct CDR-H3. SPR measurements of these antibodies revealed nanomolar-level affinities for most designs, with distinct affinity distributions across antigens: PD-L1 antibodies showed the strongest overall binding (including sub-\\(1 0 0 \\mathsf { p } \\mathsf { M }\\) candidates), while PD-1 antibodies exhibited weaker affinities (Fig. 1d, left). Notably, the substantial differences in \\(K _ { \\mathrm { D } }\\) values across Ktargets (e.g., 1000-fold between the best PD-L1 and PD-1 antibodies)\n\na\ntFold System De novo Design Workflow\nb\n\nExperiment Pipeline\nc\nDe novo Design with Best Affinity\n\n\n\n\n\nBinding KD↓ (nM)\n\n\nEdit distance to the closest antibody\n\n\n\n\nCDR-H3↑\n\n\nCDR-H↑\n\n\nVH↑\n\n\nVL↑\n\n\nFR-H↑\n\n\nFR-L↑\n\n\n\n\nFlu A\n\n\n3.22\n\n\n8\n\n\n12\n\n\n26\n\n\n15\n\n\n8\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\nPD-1\n\n\n81.6\n\n\n5\n\n\n6\n\n\n8\n\n\n8\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\nPD-L1\n\n\n0.045\n\n\n6\n\n\n8\n\n\n9\n\n\n12\n\n\n1\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\nSC2RBD\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n5\n\n\n10\n\n\n19\n\n\n10\n\n\n3\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nd\n\nResult of De novo Design\n\n\ne\n\nf\n\ng\n\nare primarily linked to the intrinsic properties of the antigens themselves.\nTo prioritize leads for therapeutic development, we focused on the highest-affinity antibody for each target.

This exception occurs because the highest-affinity Flu A candidate binds outside the intended epitope. The designated epitopes are highlighted in yellow, and the high-confidence structures predicted by tFold-Ag and AlphaFold-Multimer confirm that our designed antibodies can effectively bind to their corresponding epitopes. The SPR curves indicate rapid association and slow dissociation kinetics, which are characteristic of high-affinity binding.\n\nTo validate the de novo nature of our designs rather than modifications of existing antibodies or CDR grafting, we rigorously assessed sequence novelty metrics against known antibodies in public databases (SAbDab (Unknown 2025dl), TheraSAbDab (Unknown 2025ea), PLAbDab (Unknown 2025eb), and CoV-AbDab (Unknown 2025ec)). Edit distances to the closest antibody were calculated separately for each known antigen-specific antibody subset, ensuring unbiased assessment of novelty across all regions, including FR, CDRs, variable domains (VH/VL) and CDR-H3. The distribution of affinity and novelty metrics for all binding antibodies synthesized by the tFold system across the four targets is shown in Fig. 1d. Analysis of CDR3 and overall CDR edit distances relative to the closest known antibodies reveals that, with the exception of the PD-1-targeted antibody, all designs exhibited clear novelty in their CDR-H3 regions (edit distance \\({ \\geq } 3 )\\) ). Although the PD-1 antibody showed comparatively lower novelty scores, its CDR edit distance to the closest database entry still reached \\({ \\geq } 5 .\\) . Having established the novelty of generated antibodies, we further investigated whether this originality persists in the highest-affinity candidates—a critical consideration for therapeutic development.\nFor PD-1 and PD-L1, where established therapeutic antibodies share identical V genes (e.g., \\(\\mathtt { D [@1] 2 ^ { 4 0 } }\\) for PD-1 and GNC-03841 for PD-L1),\nour designs exhibited substantial divergence in CDR-H3. The PD-1 antibody exhibited a CDR-H3 edit distance of (Unknown 2025eo) (with D (Unknown 2025x)’s CDR-H3 length of (Unknown 2025gf) compared to our design’s (Unknown 2025fu) residues), while the PD-L1 antibody displayed a CDR-H3 edit distance of (Unknown 2025ey) (with GNC-038’s CDR-H3 length of (Unknown 2025m) compared to our design’s (Unknown 2025x) residues). For Flu A and SC2RBD, no antibodies with identical V genes exist in public databases. Notably, the Flu A design demonstrated an FR-H edit distance of (Unknown 2025do) relative to the closest known antibody, indicating complete framework novelty. Despite CoV-AbDab containing over 4000 SC2RBD-targeting antibodies, our design showed no homology in CDR-H (edit distance \\({ } = 1 0\\) ) and CDR-H3 (edit distance \\({ } = 5\\) ). These results confirm that the tFold system’s ability to generate antibodies even against wellcharacterized targets.\n\n\ntFold system can design diverse antibodies for targeting specific epitopes\nUnlike antibody engineering, de novo antibody design generates diverse candidate antibodies with significant variability, particularly in the CDR-H3. Figure 2a illustrates the CDRs of our expressed PD-L1 antibodies. We observed that while CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 displayed moderate similarity (dictated by the V gene), CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 demonstrated remarkable diversity. This combinatorial diversity in CDR regions dramatically expands the druggable sequence space (Unknown 2025eg), enabling systematic exploration of non-immunogenic paratopes that would otherwise remain inaccessible through conventional immunization or library screening methods. CDR-3 variations generated distinct antigen–antibody interaction interfaces. Structural prediction models (tFold-Ag/AlphaFold-Multimer) further validated that these computationally designed antibodies bind specifically at the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction interface, highlighting the efficacy of our structuredriven computational workflow.\nAntibodies can exert different functions by binding to various epitopes on an antigen (Unknown 2025eh). Therefore, we selected targets that possess multiple distinct epitopes (Unknown 2025ei, 2025ej, 2025ek, 2025el), with the aim of designing antibodies that specifically bind to certain epitopes to elicit the desired functions. To validate the epitope specificity of our antibodies, we conducted competition assays using SPR to evaluate their ability to block the binding of the antigen to its receptor or ligand.\nThe interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 elicits inhibitory signaling that suppresses T-cell activation through negative immunoregulatory mechanisms (Unknown 2025em). To counteract this interaction, we engineered antibodies targeting specific epitopes within the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction interface, leveraging their superior binding affinity to sterically disrupt the native PD-1/PD-L1 complex.\nAmong the candidates generated by the tFold system, three topaffinity antibodies identified through quantitative binding assessments demonstrated complete blockade efficacy in competition assays using SPR. Both PD-1-directed and PD-L1-targeted antibody formats effectively prevented PD-1/PD-L1 ligation, an outcome consistent with the potential to restore T-cell effector function through precise interference with this immune checkpoint axis (Unknown 2025en). We focused on the highest-affinity anti-PD-1 antibody (anti-PD-1-H965) and anti-PD-L1 antibody (anti-PD-L1-H635). Specifically, the SPR measurements for\n\na\nEpitope-specific Designs\n\nb\n\n\nd\n\n\ne\n\nf\n\ng\n\nh\nanti-PD-1-H965 and anti-PD-L1-H635 highlighted their competitive binding capabilities: anti-PD-1-H965 exhibited strong binding to PD-1 alone, but its response units (RU) significantly decreased in the presence of PD-L1, confirming its competition with PD-L1 for PD-1 binding. Similarly, anti-PD-L1-H635 showed substantial binding to PD-L1 alone, yet its RU values markedly declined when combined with PD-1, demonstrating its competition with PD-1 for PD-L1 binding (Fig. 2b).\nStructural alignment between the predicted antibody-antigen complexes and the PD-1/PD-L1 complex (PDB ID: 4ZQK50) revealed that the epitopes targeted by our designed antibodies correspond to a portion of the PD-1/PD-L1 binding site. Additionally, the spatial arrangement of the antibodies indicated their clash with the receptor, which aligns with our expectations. (Fig. 2c).\nFig. 2 | tFold system demonstrates diverse design capabilities for targeting antigen epitopes as intended. a CDR multiple sequence alignment of ten highaffinity Fab designed by the tFold system, highlighting significant diversity in both the lengths and sequences of CDR-H3 and CDR-L3. b Binding of anti-PD-1-H965 and anti-PD-L1-H635 to their respective epitopes was confirmed through SPR competition assays with PD-L1 (top) and PD-1 (bottom). c Predicted structural models indicate that our de novo antibodies (anti-PD-1-H965 and anti-PD-L1-H635, with blue representing the heavy chain and purple the light chains) effectively block the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 (PDB ID: 4ZQK, with gray for PD-1 and orange for PD-L1). The overlap between the epitopes of designed antibodies and epitopes of receptor is highlighted in yellow. The spatial clash between the antibodies and the receptor is highlighted in red. d The binding of anti-SC2RBD-H330 to the expected epitope was confirmed through SPR competition assays with ACE2. By blocking the interaction between SC2RBD and ACE2, anti-SC2RBD-H330 effectively neutralizes the virus, demonstrating an IC50 of 0.42 nM. e Predicted structural\nmodels confirm that anti-SC2RBD-H 330, with blue for the heavy chain and purple for the light chains, can inhibit the interaction between SC2RBD and ACE2 (PDB ID: 6M0J, with gray for SC2RBD and orange for ACE2), thereby neutralizing the SC2RBD. The spatial clash between the antibody and ACE2 is highlighted in red. f Predicted structural models confirm that anti-FluA-H169, represented in blue for the heavy chain and purple for the light chains, shares similar epitopes with the broad-spectrum antibody FluA-20 (PDB ID: 6OCB, colored by orange), while exhibiting distinct epitopes compared to another antibody, C (05?) (PDB ID: 4FP8, colored by violet). The spatial clash between anti-FluA-H169 and FluA-20 is highlighted in red. g The binding of anti-FluA-H169 to the expected epitope was confirmed through SPR competition assays with FluA-20. The presence of FluA-20 affected the binding signal of the antibody anti-FluA-H169 to the antigen Flu A. h ELISA-based epitope-specific analysis of our designed Flu A antibodies. Our designed Flu A antibodies and C (05?) do not share overlapping epitopes.\nThe high-affinity binding of SC2RBD to the ACE2 receptor on host cells initiates viral membrane fusion, enabling endocytosis and the release of the viral genome, which establishes infection and facilitates systemic dissemination (Unknown 2025eq). In comparison to PD-1 and PD-L1, designing an ACE2 blocker is more challenging for several reasons: (1) SC2RBD has a longer length and a structurally more complex epitope; (2) the affinity between SC2RBD and ACE2 is in the nanomolar range (Unknown 2025er), which necessitates that antibodies exhibit sufficiently high affinity to effectively inhibit the binding of SC2RBD to ACE2, thereby neutralizing the virus.\nWe selected five top-affinity antibodies for competition assays using SPR. Notably, 2 out of the five antibodies were recognized as effective blockers. Among these, we focused on the SC2RBD antibody with highest-affinity (anti-SC2RBD-H330). The SPR measurements for anti-SC2RBD-H330 showed its competitive binding capabilities with ACE2. Furthermore, we found that its neutralization capacity yielded an IC50 of 0.42 nanomolar (Fig. 2d). By aligning the predicted structure of the tFold system-generated antibody-antigen complex with the SC2RBD/ACE2 complex structure (PDB ID: \\(6 \\mathsf { M O J } ^ { [@5; @2] } .\\) ), we found that the epitope targeted by our designed antibody corresponds to a portion of the binding site between SC2RBD and ACE2. Additionally, the spatial arrangement indicated a clash between the antibody and the receptor, which aligns with experiments (Fig. 2e). Although the structures of the other three antibodies predicted by our model also bound to the correct epitope and exhibited high confidence scores \\(_ { ( &gt; 0 . 7 ) }\\) , the competition experiments revealed that they were unable to compete with ACE2. This observation highlights the limitations of the tFold system’s structural predictions, which still exhibit instances of false positives.\nFlu A possesses multiple epitopes (Unknown 2025ei), and FluA- \\(2 0 ^ { [@5; @3] }\\) is a broadspectrum antibody that binds with high affinity to conserved residues in the head region of the Flu A HA1. Our objective was to design antibodies with epitopes similar to those of FluA-20 to confer broadspectrum properties.\nWe selected the top four Flu A antibodies with the highest affinity and conducted competition assays with FluA-20 using SPR. Our results indicated that the binding signals of three out of the four designed Flu A antibodies (anti-FluA-H141, anti-FluA-H169, and anti-FluA-H551) were significantly affected in the presence of FluA-20. This finding suggests that these antibodies share similar epitopes with FluA-20, which aligns with our structural predictions (Fig. 2f, g). In contrast, the binding signal of the antibody with the highest affinity, anti-FluA-H093, remained unaffected. Despite high-confidence predictions from the structural model, this antibody appears to bind to an incorrect epitope. Notably, the affinity of FluA-20 for Flu A (&lt;nM) is substantially stronger than that of our designed antibodies (from (Unknown 2025b) to (Unknown 2025dt) nM), placing our antibodies at a competitive disadvantage.\nTo further validate the epitope-specific of our designed antibodies, we introduced antibody \\({ \\mathsf { C } } { \\mathsf { 0 } } { 5 } ^ { [@5; @4] }\\) , which targets distinct regions\nof Flu A compared to FluA-20. Using ELISA, we confirmed that there was no competition between C (05?) and our designed antibodies (Fig. 2h). This result is consistent with their intended targeting of the FluA-20 epitope, effectively ruling out interference from neighboring sites and validating the specificity of our design strategy.\nWe have demonstrated the experimental validation of the tFold system across four distinct therapeutic targets. Next, we will return to the tFold system to elucidate how it addresses various challenges associated with the de novo design of epitope-specific antibodies.\n\n\ntFold-Ab: fast and accurate antibody structures prediction\nThe accurate prediction of antibody structures is crucial for understanding their function and is a prerequisite for the tFold system in antibody design. The component of the tFold system responsible for predicting antibody structures is referred to as tFold-Ab, which can independently generate high-resolution, atomic-level 3D structures of antibodies from their amino acid sequences in seconds.\nThe tFold-Ab consists of four main modules that include a pretrained protein language model (PLM): ESM-PPI, a feature updating module: Evoformer-Single stack, a structure module, and a recycling module (Fig. 3a). The ESM-PPI module extracts both intra-chain and inter-chain information of the protein complex to generate features for the downstream structure prediction task. We develop ESM-PPI by extending the current ESM-2 model (Unknown 2025et) through further pre-training using both monomers and multimers. This enhancement enables the model to effectively extract inter-chain information. The Evoformer-Single stack updates and refines the input features from the ESM-PPI, iteratively update the sequence and pairwise representations. The structure module, which performs SE(3)-equivariant updates using invariant point attention (Unknown 2025eu), then maps the obtained representation to predicted atomic-level 3D structures. Finally, the recycling module allows tFold-Ab to reuse the features and structure predictions of the previous iteration, enhancing the final structure prediction quality.\ntFold-Ab achieves state-of-the-art computational efficiency in antibody structure prediction by utilizing ESM-PPI instead of traditional MSA-based methods for co-evolutionary information extraction. It features an optimized Evoformer-Single stack and a structure module for end-to-end prediction of backbone and side-chain conformations. In contrast, existing methods like DeepAb (Unknown 2025ev) and IgFold (Unknown 2025ew) rely on time-consuming Rosetta-based energy minimization for side-chain prediction, while Chai- \\(\\cdot [@1] ^ { [@5; @9] }\\) requires extensive sampling via diffusion. This MSA-free design yields substantial speed gains: compared to the heavily engineered AlphaFold-3 Server, tFold-Ab offers a 50-fold advantage, and as shown in Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 2 it is 5000 times faster than AlphaFold-Multimer (Unknown 2025dq). Even when compared to an AlphaFold-Multimer variant that omits MSA and template search, tFold-Ab demonstrates superior speed. This indicates the efficiency of the Evoformer-Single over the conventional Evoformer.

To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of tFold-Ab’s performance, we have curated a test set, held out from the training and validation data, based on a cutoff date of (01?) July 2022. It comprises two non-redundant benchmark subsets, namely\nSAbDab-22H2-Ab and SAbDab-22H2-Nano, which include 169 paired antibodies and (Unknown 2025fn) single-chain nanobodies, respectively. We utilize the widely adopted temporally separated approach during data preparation to guarantee fair comparisons between tFold-Ab and other existing methods.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 3c and Table (Unknown 2025dh), tFold-Ab achieves high performance in antibody structure prediction with average root-mean-\nFig. 3 | Overview and performance evaluation of the tFold-Ab. a Overview of the tFold-Ab architecture, with arrows indicating the direction of information flow.

In the case of monomer structure prediction methods, the heavy and light chains are predicted separately, and the OCD metric is not evaluated (denoted by \\(\" - \\prime \\prime )\\) . The antibody numbering scheme employed is Chothia. H-Fr indicates the Fr of H chain and H (Unknown 2025a)-H (Unknown 2025ds) indicate the CDRs of H chain.

AlphaFold-3 uses the default parameters of the AlphaFold Server (one random seed, five samplings, and selects the result with the highest ranking score for evaluation).\nsquared-deviation (RMSD) values of 0.61 Å and 0.57 Å for the FR in the heavy chains and light chains, respectively. In the more complex task of predicting the CDRs, tFold-Ab achieves average RMSD of 0.92, 0.84, and (Unknown 2025ds).01 Å in the CDR-1, CDR-2, and CDR-3 regions of the heavy chains (denoted as H (Unknown 2025a), H (Unknown 2025dh), and H (Unknown 2025ds) regions), along with RMSD of 0.87, 0.73, and (Unknown 2025a).12 Å in the corresponding CDRs of the light chains (denoted as L (Unknown 2025a), L (Unknown 2025dh), and L (Unknown 2025ds) regions). All RMSD scores are calculated over the backbone heavy atoms, following the alignment of the respective framework residues. We compared tFold-Ab with the currently existing general protein structure prediction methods, including AlphaFold- \\(\\cdot [@3] ^ { [@2; @9] }\\) , AlphaFold-Multimer (Unknown 2025dq), ESMFold (Unknown 2025et), Chai-159, as well as antibody-specific methods, including IgFold (Unknown 2025ew), DeepAb (Unknown 2025ev), ImmuneBuilder (Unknown 2025fa). In the FRs, all the examined methods consistently exhibited the highest performance compared to other regions. The CDR-H3 and CDR-L3, however, are the most challenging components for prediction, due to the significant sequence and structural diversities in these regions. Overall, tFold-Ab demonstrates superior performance compared to both general protein structure prediction methods and antibody-specific methods across all framework regions and CDRs of both chains.\nThe anticipated orientation between the heavy and light chains plays a crucial role in determining the overall binding surface. To assess the accuracy of the inter-chain orientation, we measured the orientational coordinate distance \\(( \\mathrm { O C D } ) ^ { [@6; @2] }\\) . Our findings indicate that, in general, tFold-Ab achieves significantly better OCD values compared to the other methods evaluated, with a substantial margin. Specifically, tFold-Ab yields an OCD of (Unknown 2025ed).20, while the competing methods range from (Unknown 2025ed).55 to (Unknown 2025eo).31. To further evaluate the accuracy of the predicted antibody complex structure of paired chains, we include four metrics, including the DockQ, fraction of native contacts (Fnat), ligand rootmean-square deviation (LRMS), and the interface root-mean-square deviation (iRMS). As shown in Supplementary Table (Unknown 2025ds), AlphaFold-3\nachieves the best performance among the evaluated methods, with an average DockQ score of 0.781, while tFold-Ab has a score of 0.77. In addition, tFold-Ab achieves the lowest average LRMS and iRMS scores, indicating its exceptional accuracy in predicting both ligand and interface positions.\nNanobodies, as a promising format for therapeutic development, have gained considerable attention currently. Different from the paired antibodies, nanobodies lack the second immunoglobulin chain. This characteristic, coupled with the increased length of the nanobody CDR-3 loop, results in a wide range of CDR-3 conformations that are not typically observed in paired antibodies (Unknown 2025fc). The performance of tFold-Ab and other existing general and antibody-specific methods is compared in Fig. 3d and Table (Unknown 2025ds). All evaluated methods show the highest accuracy in framework regions, highlighting their predictability. In contrast, the CDR-3 loop presents the greatest challenge due to its complexity and variability. Generally, tFold-Ab performs well in most regions, especially in the challenging CDR-3 region, where its average RMSD is \\(3.57 \\text{ Å}\\), compared to baseline RMSDs ranging from (Unknown 2025ds).57 to \\(9.03 \\text{ Å}\\).\nFigure 3f, g present example predicted structures of antibodies and nanobodies, providing an intuitive visualization of the prediction results. It is observed that tFold-Ab is capable of providing highly accurate predictions for the CDR-H3 and the CDR-3, which are the most challenging regions in the structure prediction of antibodies and nanobodies, respectively.\ntFold-Ag: fast modeling of antibody-antigen complex structures The component of the antibody-antigen complex prediction model employed in the Fold System, termed tFold-Ag, is illustrated in Fig. 4a. tFold-Ag comprises three main components: the antibody feature generation unit, the antigen feature generation unit, and the\nTable (Unknown 2025ds) | Performance of nanobody structure prediction on the SAbDab-22H2-Nano benchmark\n\n\n\nMethod\n\n\nFr\n\n\nCDR-1\n\n\nCDR-2\n\n\nCDR-3\n\n\n\n\nAlphaFold-3\n\n\n0.68\n\n\n1.73\n\n\n1.14\n\n\n3.57\n\n\n\n\nAlphaFold\n\n\n0.71\n\n\n1.96\n\n\n1.20\n\n\n3.96\n\n\n\n\nChai-1\n\n\n0.73\n\n\n1.80\n\n\n1.13\n\n\n3.57\n\n\n\n\nESMFold\n\n\n0.70\n\n\n1.87\n\n\n1.34\n\n\n3.80\n\n\n\n\nOmegaFold\n\n\n0.73\n\n\n1.77\n\n\n1.34\n\n\n3.63\n\n\n\n\nHelixFold-Single\n\n\n0.76\n\n\n1.92\n\n\n1.27\n\n\n4.16\n\n\n\n\nIgFold\n\n\n0.73\n\n\n1.97\n\n\n1.29\n\n\n4.64\n\n\n\n\nDeepAb\n\n\n0.93\n\n\n2.36\n\n\n1.51\n\n\n9.03\n\n\n\n\nImmuneBuilder\n\n\n0.75\n\n\n1.91\n\n\n1.23\n\n\n3.79\n\n\n\n\ntFold-Ab\n\n\n0.67\n\n\n1.95\n\n\n1.20\n\n\n3.57\n\n\n\nReported are the backbone RMSD across vaious framework and CDRs, utilizing Chothia as the antibody numbering scheme, the bold values indicate the minimum (best-performing) results.

The antibody feature generation unit utilizes the pre-trained tFold-Ab to extract sequence and pair representations, as well as the initial atomic coordinates of the antibodies, while remaining fixed during training to optimize model convergence. The antigen feature generation unit employs the pretrained AlphaFold 256 to derive MSA and pair representations together with initial structures of diverse antigens, enhancing tFold-Ag’s generalizability across various sources. The representation-driven flexible docking unit consists of a feature fusion module and a complex structure prediction module. After obtaining the necessary representations and coordinates from the feature generation units, the feature fusion module integrates this information to create initial representations of the antibody-antigen complex. The complex structure prediction module, featuring an Evoformer-Single stack with (Unknown 2025dv) blocks and a structure module with (Unknown 2025fu) blocks, updates these representations and maps them to the predicted complex structure, providing confidence scores. In the representation-driven flexible docking unit, tFold-Ag not only calculates the conformation of the antibodyantigen complex but also updates the structures of both the antibody and antigen, allowing for refinement of the initially extracted structures (Supplementary Fig. 6). For example, the prediction accuracy of the highly variable CDR-H3 region improves in tFold-Ag, with RMSD decreasing from (Unknown 2025ds).21 Å to (Unknown 2025ds).07 Å when accurate epitope information is available (Supplementary Table (Unknown 2025bp)). Additionally, an extra sequence recovery module is integrated to facilitate antibody design. During training, tFold-Ag simultaneously optimizes shared and specific modules for complex structure prediction and antibody design, functioning as a multi-task model. This optimization acts as a regularization task, benefiting both structure prediction and antibody design.\nWe curate a hold-out test set to evaluate the performance of structure prediction methods on antibody-antigen complexes from the SAbDab (Unknown 2025dl), using a temporally separated approach. To ensure fair comparison with existing methods like AlphaFold-Multimer (Unknown 2025eu) and AlphaFold \\(\\cdot [@3] ^ { [@2; @9] }\\) , we set the cutoff date to July (Unknown 2025a), 2022, ensuring that none of the evaluated methods has seen the test set structures. The final test set consists of two non-redundant benchmark subsets: SAbDab-22H2- AbAg, which includes (Unknown 2025gp) antibody-antigen complexes, and SAbDab-22H2-NanoAg, which includes (Unknown 2025ef) nanobody-antigen complexes.\nWe compare tFold-Ag with currently available end-to-end methods (Unknown 2025fd) 65,, including AlphaFold-Multimer (Unknown 2025dq) and AlphaFold- \\(\\cdot [@3] ^ { [@2; @9] }\\) , as well as docking-based methods such as conventional docking methods (Unknown 2025ff, 2025fg, 2025fh) and deep-neural-network-involved docking methods (Unknown 2025fi, 2025fk, 2025fl). As illustrated in Fig. 4b and Table (Unknown 2025ed), AlphaFold-3 significantly outperforms other methods on the SAbDab-22-AbAg test set, achieving a\nDockQ score of 0.257 and a success rate (SR, the proportion of predicted structures that meet an acceptable criterion \\(\\mathrm { ( D o c k Q &gt; 0 . [@2; @3] ) }\\) ) of \\([@3; @2] . 3 \\%\\) , making it the only method to have a SR above \\(30 \\%\\) . The proposed tFold-Ag ranks second, outperforming other end-to-end and docking-based methods with a DockQ score of 0.217 and a SR of \\([@2; @8] . 3 \\%\\) . AlphaFold-Multimer ranks third, with a DockQ score of 0.158 and a SR of \\([@1; @8] . 2 \\%\\) . A similar trend is observed in the prediction of nanobody–antigen complexes (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table (Unknown 2025dh)), where AlphaFold-3 demonstrates even greater superiority, achieving a DockQ score of 0.296 and a SR of \\([@3; @4] . 2 \\%\\) , significantly surpassing both tFold-Ag and AlphaFold-Multimer. In this context, tFold-Ag achieves a SR of \\([@1; @9] . 5 \\%\\) , slightly outperforming AlphaFold-Multimer, which has a SR of \\([@1; @4] . 5 \\%\\) . The overall performance of tFold-Ag is limited by its training on SAbDab data alone, in contrast to AlphaFold-3, which is trained on comprehensive molecular data using diffusion-based sampling. This limitation is particularly evident in nanobody–antigen complexes, where fewer experimental structures are available for model training. As a result, tFold-Ag performs worse on nanobody–antigen complexes compared to antibody-antigen complexes due to the lack of training data. Nevertheless, tFold-Ag demonstrates a \\(32 \\%\\) improvement in SR compared to AlphaFold-Multimer.\nAlthough tFold-Ag slightly lags behind AlphaFold-3 in prediction accuracy, it offers significantly optimized computational speed. tFold-Ag is over ten times faster than MSA-based structure prediction methods (e.g., AlphaFold-Multimer and AlphaFold-3) for antibodyantigen complex predictions across varying sequence lengths (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 8). This speed advantage arises from tFold-Ag’s use of the Antibody and Antigen Feature Generation Unit, which extracts features without the need for MSA searches. The strong performance of tFold-Ab has demonstrated that antibody structural features can be effectively modeled by language models. Additionally, due to the sparse co-evolutionary information between antigens and antibodies, MSA pairing is unnecessary. We employ a representationdriven flexible docking unit to simulate the docking performance of antibodies and antigens, achieving good structural prediction while significantly optimizing speed. Consequently, the speed advantage of tFold-Ag will become increasingly pronounced when predicting complex structures for multiple antibodies against a specific target antigen in a high-throughput manner. As the antigen feature generation unit is the most time-consuming component due to MSA, the average time required for predicting each antibody-antigen complex will decrease with an increasing number of antibodies screened against a particular antigen (Supplementary Fig. 8).\nFigure 4d illustrate examples of predicted antibody-antigen and nanobody–antigen complexes, along with the corresponding experimental structures, demonstrating that tFold-Ag can provide highquality predictions of the interaction interfaces between antibodies or nanobodies and antigens.\nIn structural biology, alongside direct experimental methods like cryo-electron microscopy, there are more cost-effective and accessible approaches that provide valuable interaction interface information, which can serve as structural constraints in protein complex predictions. For instance, chemical cross-linking (XL) technology reveals distances between residues linked by fixed-length reagents, translating into contacts between antibodies and antigens. Additionally, deep mutation scanning offers insights into protein–protein interaction (PPI) information, including antigen epitopes and antibody paratopes. While these experimental constraints are sparse and insufficient for complete structural determination, they provide critical insights into the interaction interfaces. In tFold-Ag, we propose to integrate extra structure restraint feature for better protein complex structure prediction by utilizing a specially designed Inter-chain feature embedding module, which incorporates interface information into the single and pair representations generated by the feature fusion module. We\n\na\ntFold-Ag Model Pipeline\n\n\nComplex Interface Prediction\n\n\nc\nRuntime Analysis\n\nd\nComplex Interface Prediction Example\n\n\ne\nImproving Accuracy using Extra Structure Restraints\nf\n\nCorrelation between ipTM and DockQ\n\n\ng\nPerformance Complementary with AF\n\ndenote tFold-Ag utilizing PPI information (antigen epitope sites or both antigen epitope and antibody paratope sites) as tFold-Ag-ppi, and the more detailed contact information (contact maps between epitope and paratope sites) as tFold-Ag-contact. Our findings indicate that tFold-Ag significantly benefits from additional structural constraints, with performance improvements correlating with the detail of interaction interface information (Table (Unknown 2025ed) and Supplementary Table (Unknown 2025dh)).\nWhen provided with both antigen epitope and antibody paratope information, tFold-Ag achieves a DockQ score of 0.416 for antibody–antigen structure prediction and 0.316 for nanobody–antigen structures (Table (Unknown 2025ed) and Supplementary Table (Unknown 2025dh)).

AlphaFold-3 uses the default parameters of the AlphaFold Server (one random seed, five samplings, and selects the result with the highest-ranking score for evaluation). ColabFold uses MMseqs (Unknown 2025dh) to construct MSA and the parameters of AlphaFold-Multimer to predict structures.\nupon specifying the correct antibody paratope, the DockQ score increases to 0.55.\nStrongly correlated confidence scores assist users in assessing the accuracy of predicted structures. We examined the relationship between the prediction confidence score and the prediction accuracy of tFold-Ag, using interface pTM (ipTM) and DockQ as evaluation metrics. Significant positive correlations were observed between ipTM and DockQ for antibody-antigen data (Pearson correlation coefficient \\(r = 0 . [@7; @7] ,\\) ) and relatively strong correlations for nanobody–antigen data \\(\\left( r = 0 . [@4; @9] \\right)\\) . We consider tFold-Ag’s predictions sufficiently accurate rwhen ipTM exceeds 0.8. These positive correlations persist when incorporating interface information into tFold-Ag, such as in tFold-Agppi using epitope information or both epitope and paratope information (Fig. 4f, Table (Unknown 2025ed), Supplementary Table (Unknown 2025dh) and Supplementary Fig. 7).\nNotably, as representative methods for using without and with the MSA of antibodies, it is worth noting that employing both tFold-Ag and AlphaFold-Multimer or AlphaFold-3 cooperatively in an ensemble manner can lead to improved structure predictions. This conclusion is based on a point-to-point performance comparison between tFold-Ag and AlphaFold-Multimer on the relevant test sets (Supplementary Table (Unknown 2025cw)), revealing that the two methods yield highly complementary results. tFold-Ag and AlphaFold-Multimer excel on different targets. Although the confidence scores from these methods vary, a higher prediction confidence score generally indicates a more accurate predicted structure. Therefore, the prediction with the highest confidence score is selected as the ensembled prediction. Using this ensemble strategy, the DockQ and SR for antibody-antigen complexes improve from 0.217 and \\([@2; @8] . 3 \\%\\) (using tFold-Ag independently) to 0.288 and \\(4 0 . 4 \\%\\) (using the ensemble strategy), respectively (Fig. 4g, Table (Unknown 2025ed) and Supplementary Table (Unknown 2025cw)). The prediction accuracy of the tFold-Ag and AlphaFold-Multimer ensemble surpasses that of AlphaFold-3, and further improvements in prediction accuracy are achieved when tFold-Ag and AlphaFold-3 are combined.\n\n\nStructure-guided virtual screening of binding antibodies\nIn the early stages of therapeutic antibody development, the primary objective is to select high-affinity binders, from candidates obtained through animal immunization or phage display technologies. Traditional wet-lab techniques, such as ELISA, FACS, and emerging optofluidic systems, can filter out some non-binding antibodies, but lack the accuracy of high-precision macromolecular interaction measurements such as SPR or Bio-Layer Interferometry \\(( \\mathtt { B L I } ) ^ { [@7; @3] }\\) . Subjecting thousands of antibodies to expression and purification followed by SPR or BLI incurs significant time and cost. Additionally, in the tFold system, the generator produces numerous candidate antibodies, many of which are non-binding, posing a substantial challenge in filtering these candidates.\nTo address this challenge, we explored the potential of the tFold-Ag model to predict structures while distinguishing between binders and non-binders. This computational approach evaluates an antibody’s binding potential by analyzing predicted confidence scores that indicate the likelihood of strong binding interactions. The tFold-Ag model, trained exclusively on binding antibody-antigen pairs, assigns lower confidence scores to non-binding complexes, reflecting their reduced likelihood of forming stable structures. Building on previous work (Unknown 2025fo), we anticipate that these confidence scores will serve as a reliable metric for effectively differentiating between binding and nonbinding antibody-antigen pairs.\nAs part of the tFold system, we employed a similar approach to filter candidate antibodies in the process.

This evaluation aims to assess the performance of tFold-Ag in virtual screening, which means identifying binding antibodies from a pool of candidate antibody sequences.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 5a, tFold-Ag effectively distinguishes PD-1- binding antibodies from non-binding ones, achieving an AUC of 0.76 based on the computed confidence scores. Remarkably, within the top \\(1 \\%\\) of the antibody ranking list determined by tFold-Ag, we observe an enrichment factor \\(( \\mathsf { E F } ^ { 1 \\% } )\\) of (Unknown 2025fj).41, indicating that two out of seven antibodies identified as high-confidence binders are positive samples,\nFig. 5 | Structure-guided virtual screening for binding antibodies with tFold-Ag. a ROC curve for PD-1 set in distinguishing between binding and non-binding antibodies. b Performance of virtual screening for identifying binding antibodies against PD-1 from a dataset of 745 antibodies, featuring (Unknown 2025dp) positive samples.

Distributions of their scores are also presented.\nas confirmed in Fig. 5b. This strong correlation between tFold-Ag confidence score and the antigen-binding capability of antibodies underscores its utility in virtual screening. Furthermore, we assess the validity of our predicted complex structures of anti-PD1 antibodies sourced from Thera-SAbDab, all of which are either in clinical use or approved, with no experimental structures currently available. Although there are eight epitopes for anti-PD145 that exhibit blocking and agonist functions, these antibodies are confirmed to block the PD1-PDL1 interaction, reflecting their pharmacological role. Using tFold-Ag, we predicted the structure of Lipustobart, the top-ranked antibody, and confirmed the similarity of its binding site to PD-L1. Structural superimposition with the PD-1/PD-L1 complex (PDB ID: 4ZQK50) demonstrates its potential for competitive binding with PD-1, as illustrated in Fig. 5c. We present the top five positive sample antibodies ranked by our method (Fig. 5d), all of which have confidence scores greater than 0.8. While these antibodies bind to slightly different epitopes, they share overlapping epitopes and spatial proximity with PD-L1. This alignment with their functional capability to block PD-L1 indicates that tFold-Ag’s predictions accurately reflect their function.\nTo evaluate the virtual screening performance for the SC2RBD, we utilized antibodies from a single-B cell repertoire sequencing dataset (Unknown 2025fp). This approach enables us to assess the model’s predictive accuracy on data distributions, confirming its generalizability. The normalized number of effective sequences (Neff) for the MSA of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is (Unknown 2025ed).9, compared to (Unknown 2025fu).3 for PD-1, indicating fewer diverse homologous sequences for the SC2RBD, making the prediction more challenging. Additionally, the cutoff date for tFold-Ag’s training set is (Unknown 2025du) December 2021, while most antibody structures capable of binding to the SC2RBD were released in 2022 or later, further challenging the model due to limited training samples. Despite these difficulties, tFold-Ag achieves an AUC of 0.70 (Fig. 5e) and an \\(\\mathsf { E F } ^ { 1 \\% }\\) of (Unknown 2025dh).35, indicating moderate success in discriminating binding from non-binding antibodies. Using the Kabsch algorithm, we superimpose a highconfidence predicted antibody-antigen structure with the RBD/ACE2 complex (PDB ID: 6M0J52), revealing overlapping epitopes and spatial clashes (Fig. 5f) indicative of competitive binding, which was experimentally validated. However, the relatively low confidence scores for the antibody-SC2RBD complex predictions complicate the assessment of the competitive potential based solely on structural data. While the predicted structures offer insights, their accuracy may be limited, which makes it challenging to definitively determine competitive binding based solely on these predictions. Further details of our analysis are provided in the Supplementary Information.\nTo further explore the correlation between confidence scores generated by structure prediction and binding specificity, we selected (Unknown 2025ee) antibodies designed by the tFold system. The antigens they specifically bind to serve as positive samples, and another (Unknown 2025ds) antigens as negative samples. We used tFold-Ag and AlphaFold-3 to predict the\nstructures of 160 antibody-antigen complexes, respectively, to determine whether the correct antigen could be selected based on confidence scores. This is a more challenging test set because these antibodies have identical FRs. The AUC curves and confidence score distributions are shown in Fig. 5g.\nOverall, for PD-1 designs, the confidence scores of tFold-Ag and AlphaFold-3 showed strong correlation, with AUCs of 0.95 and 0.74, respectively. This may be attributed to the presence of PD-1 antibodies with FRs IGHV3-23/IGKV1-5 in SAbDab, enabling more accurate prediction of such antibody-antigen complexes by structural prediction algorithms. In contrast, the correlation was weaker for Flu A and PD-L1: tFold-Ag yielded AUCs of 0.63 and 0.65, while AlphaFold-3 yielded 0.61 and 0.68, respectively. For the more challenging SC2RBD, the confidence scores of tFold-Ag and AlphaFold-3 showed almost no correlation with binding specificity. Notably, most of the top-ranked antibodies by tFold-Ag were positive samples, which is partially related to the pipeline of the tFold system but also indicates that the confidence scores of tFold-Ag can, to some extent, distinguish the specific binding between antibodies and antigens. The confidence scores of AlphaFold-3 are somewhat informative for Flu A and PD-L1, but perform poorly for other targets.\nIn summary, the evaluation results confirm tFold-Ag’s effectiveness in identifying binding antibodies by accurately reconstructing antibody-antigen complexes. Notably, while MSAs of antigens are essential, MSAs of antibodies are not required, providing a significant speed advantage in high-throughput virtual screening (Supplementary Fig. 8). This structure-guided screening approach, distinct from sequence-based methods, can identify binding antibodies to antigens not present in the training set. Furthermore, it can be integrated with energy-based methods (Unknown 2025x) 76, to enhance the efficiency of the virtual screening process. This broadens its applicability to single B-cell receptor repertoire sequencing data and supports de novo antibody design in complex pharmaceutical contexts.\n\n\nJoint antibody structure prediction and sequence recovery\nBeyond structure prediction, the tFold system implements sequence recovery as a critical component in de novo antibody design. To enable joint antibody structure prediction and sequence recovery, we extended tFold-Ag into a multitask framework integrating two modules: a structure prediction head for antibody-antigen complex modeling and a sequence recovery head for masked residue reconstruction (Fig. 6a). The workflow employs Evoformer-Single to iteratively optimize masked antibody features alongside antigen inputs. Masked regions are reconstructed through the sequence recovery head, with predicted sequences subsequently fed to the structure module for the joint prediction of antigen–antibody complex conformations and antibody sequences.\nDuring training, dual-task optimization synchronizes structuresequence co-design. For structure prediction, established protocols (Unknown 2025dq) 29,\n\na\nJoint Antibody Structure Prediction and Sequence Recovery\n\nb\nAntibody CDR-H3 Recovery\nc\n\nCorrelation between iplddt and AAR\n\n\nd\nStructure and Sequence Co-design Prediction\n\nFig. 6 | Joint antibody structure prediction and sequence recovery with tFold-Ag. a Joint structure-sequence prediction workflow of tFold-Ag: masked antibody residues are encoded by ESM-PPI for feature extraction, followed by repr.-driven flexible docking. Compared to the original tFold-Ag, an additional sequence recovery head is included to predict the masked amino acids and output the confidence score (iplddt) of the masked amino acids. b Performance of antibody amino acid recovery (AAR) for CDR-H3 of tFold-Ag and other antibody design methods on SAbDab-22-Design-Ab \\(( n = 5 0 )\\) ) test set. c Correlation between iplddt\nand AAR of CDR-H3 in SAbDab-22-Design-Ab \\(\\left( n = 5 0 \\right)\\) .

The heavy chain is shown in blue, the light chain in purple, and the respective experimental structures in gray. Correctly predicted amino acids are highlighted in blue.\nare adopted using experimental structures as supervision. For antibody design, strategic masking targets key functional regions (e.g., CDRs of heavy/light chains), with the original sequences providing recovery supervision and experimental structures guiding complex conformation prediction. This dual supervision enables the model to account for antigen-antibody interactions during generation, producing antibodies with native-like sequences and structurally plausible complexes. Notably, the framework supports the optional integration of interface information to enhance both structure prediction and antibody design. As demonstrated in the previous section, variants like tFold-Ag-ppi (utilizing epitope and paratope) exemplify this adaptable architecture.\nTo optimize tFold-Ag for both complex structure prediction and antibody design, we implemented a three-stage training process. The initial stage focuses solely on structure prediction and omits the sequencemasking process. In the subsequent fine-tuning stages with different parameters such as learning rate and sequence crop size, we introduce a random masking process for the CDRs of antibodies, applying a \\(30 \\%\\) probability of masking an amino acid (with a \\(70 \\%\\) probability of retaining its original form) to co-train the model for both tasks.\nOur method employs a co-design approach that ensures the generated antibodies are suitable from both sequence and structural perspectives, unlike previous two-stage methods that typically focus\non either structure (Unknown 2025dk) or sequence (Unknown 2025fr). Furthermore, our approach supports various types of prior inputs, including epitopes and paratope, without requiring the structural information of the antigen complex. This contrasts with existing methods that depend on experimentally determined antibody-antigen complex structures (Unknown 2025fs), antibody structures (Unknown 2025ft), or antigen structures along with binding epitopes (Unknown 2025fk) 80,. As a result, our method theoretically enables the modeling of conformational changes in antibodies and antigens before and after binding.\nWe evaluated the performance of tFold-Ag in CDRs recovery for both chains of the antibody through in silico evaluation. For this purpose, we curated two test sets, termed SAbDab-22-DesignAb (including (Unknown 2025ep) antibody-antigen pairs) and Cov-AbDab-DesignAb (77 antibodyantigen pairs), respectively. We assessed the generalization ability of tFold-Ag to generate binding antibodies for unseen antigens in the SAbDab-22-DesignAb set and antibodies for target antigens in the Cov-AbDab-DesignAb set. The performance of tFold-Ag to generate binding antibodies for unseen antigens is illustrated in Fig. 6b and Supplementary Table (Unknown 2025ed), where it is also compared with other existing methods that require prior knowledge. We employed the amino acid recovery (AAR) and contact amino acid recovery (CAAR) metrics for our in silico evaluation. It is important to note that a higher AAR or CAAR does not necessarily indicate better performance, while a sequence that diverges from the original does not automatically imply ineffective antibody design. However, these metrics are commonly used in various machine learning studies, thereby justifying their inclusion in our analysis.\nWe observed that tFold-Ag, without any prior information, achieves AARs of 0.302 and 0.267 for CDR-H3 in SAbDab-22-DesignAb and Cov-AbDab-DesignAb, respectively. These recovery rates are comparable to the leading method, dyMEAN, which requires prior epitope information. We then evaluated the impact of additional structural restraint features on tFold-Ag’s antibody CDRs recovery performance. As shown in Supplementary Table (Unknown 2025ed), incorporating these features significantly enhances CDRs recovery performance (tFold-Agppi vs. tFold-Ag). When epitope information is included, the CDR-H3 AAR for SAbDab-22-DesignAb improves to 0.317, surpassing dyMEAN \\(( \\mathsf { A A R } = 0 . [@3; @1] 0 )\\) , underscoring the importance of epitope information in CDR-H3 design. However, the CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 AARs for tFold-Ag are lower than those of dyMEAN70. This is attributed to both CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 being encoded by the V gene, in which a reasonable performance \\(( \\mathsf { A A R } = 0 . [@7; @2] 6\\) for CDR-H1 and 0.427 for CDR-H2) can be achieved using the sequence-based model ESM-PPI. When tFold-Ag incorporates antigen structure information for these regions, it often introduces interference, as CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 do not always bind to the antigen. Additionally, we observed that tFold-Ag generally has lower CAAR values. Besides designing paired antibodies, tFold-Ag is also suitable for nanobody design, with more in silico evaluation provided in supplementary information.\nIn Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig (Unknown 2025x), we investigate the correlation between the confidence score of structure prediction and the quality of antibody sequence recovery, as evaluated by AAR. Our in silico experiments indicate that while the confidence score provided by ipTM does not correlate with design quality, the residue-level confidence score of our designed region, termed iplddt, is associated with the quality of antibody sequence recovery. Higher iplddt scores typically result in antibodies that are more similar to positive sequences, allowing us to use iplddt as a metric for assessing the performance of CDR-H3 sequences designed by tFold-Ag. Moreover, we found that single-step recovery often results in a high frequency of the “YYY” (Tyrosine) motif, which is particularly significant in paratope contact sites, where it is the most abundant amino acid residue \\(( [@1; @9] \\% ) ^ { [@8; @1] }\\) . However, this prevalence adversely affects the diversity of CDR-H3 sequences generated by the tFold system, leading to a lower average iplddt score. To address this challenge, we implement a step-by-step sequence generation approach within the tFold system, similar to\nmethodologies employed in previous studies (Unknown 2025fx). In this approach, each step focuses on recovering the amino acid sequence type for a single position that is determined by the highest iplddt score, with the updated input being fed back into the model. Compared to the singlestep method, this step-by-step strategy significantly reduces the proportion of repetitive motifs and simultaneously improves the average iplddt score.\nFigure 6d presents examples of the sequences and structures of the designed antibodies generated from tFold-Ag and tFold-Ag-ppi (with epitope). As a key component of the tFold system, tFold-Ag is capable of producing innovative antibody sequences with multiple amino acid modifications in an end-to-end manner, while still preserving a high structural similarity to their naturally occurring counterparts.\n\n\nDiscussion\nOur wet-lab validation across multiple targets confirms the feasibility of the tFold system for de novo computational antibody design targeting specific epitopes. However, we acknowledge that the current success rate of generating functional antibody binders remains modest, which stems from the inherent challenge of de novo designantibodies primarily rely on flexible CDRs for antigen binding, a scenario that is more complex than that of designing protein binders based on rigid secondary structure elements. The tFold system currently yields binders at an approximate success rate ranging from (Unknown 2025a).5 to \\(4 . 4 \\%\\) . A similarly low success rate has also been observed in the recent RFAntibody (Unknown 2025dk). This shared low success rate across specialized antibody design platforms underscores the necessity of coupling computational designs with experimental binder identification pipelines, such as phage or yeast display libraries, to effectively filter candidates and advance functional binders.\nA key limitation of the tFold system lies in its insufficient discriminative power to reliably distinguish true binders from nonbinders. Although tFold-Ag’s confidence scores provide a useful ranking metric, their sensitivity diminishes for candidates sharing identical FRs. Furthermore, these confidence scores show weak sensitivity to mutations in either antibodies or antigens, limiting their utility in assessing affinity changes or immune escape. Structural inaccuracies in nanobody–antigen complex predictions further contribute to lower success rates for nanobody design compared to conventional antibodies. Additionally, the system is currently restricted to designing antibodies against monomeric antigens and cannot target complex antigens such as peptide-MHC. Challenges also arise when targeting epitopes absent in training datasets. For example, attempts to design an anti–PD-1 agonist for the MPER region of PD-145 consistently yielded low-confidence predictions, likely due to the absence of this structural motif in SAbDAb. The system’s capability to pioneer antibodies for targets remains an open question requiring further exploration.\nFollowing the completion of this study, the release of AlphaFold-29 \\(3 ^ { [@2; @9] }\\) marked a significant advancement in antibody–antigen complex prediction accuracy (Unknown 2025fy). Comparative analyses between tFold-Ag and AlphaFold-3 confirm AlphaFold-3’s superior performance in predicting antibody-antigen interactions, as well as confidence score correlation with structural precision. Recent studies (Unknown 2025dk) have demonstrated that integrating AlphaFold-3 filtering into computational workflows can substantially improve experimental success rates. Consequently, incorporating AlphaFold-3 or AlphaFold-3-similar model (Unknown 2025ex) 84,,85 into the tFold system workflow may enhance virtual screening efficiency and increase the likelihood of identifying high-affinity therapeutic candidates.\nDespite these limitations, the tFold system demonstrates transformative potential. Successfully designed antibodies exhibit nanomolar to picomolar affinities, epitope-specific binding, and functional ligand blockade, which are key milestones in therapeutic\ndevelopment. Critically, tFold-generated antibodies offer advantages over traditional methods. Each design is guided by explicit structural hypotheses, enabling precise targeting of predefined epitopes. This capability is unattainable with antibodies derived from animal immunization, which often exhibit promiscuous binding.\nThe tFold system synergizes powerfully with experimental highthroughput screening. Phage display libraries, for instance, can efficiently identify high-affinity binders from computationally generated designs. Combinatorial library screening, which involves mixing heavy and light chains from designs with similar binding modes, enhances the identification of epitope-specific antibodies while compensating for design inaccuracies. This hybrid computational-experimental pipeline achieves notable speed and cost efficiency compared to conventional approaches such as immunization or random library screening.\nIn conclusion, the tFold system transcends its original role as a structure prediction tool, emerging as a versatile platform for antibody innovation. By systematically mapping antibody-antigen interaction landscapes, it enables rational exploration of sequence-structurefunction relationships. Future advancements in prediction accuracy, combined with virtual screening and iterative optimization protocols, could position the tFold system as an indispensable engine for accelerating discoveries in structural bioinformatics and therapeutic antibody engineering. Bridging the gap between proof-of-concept designs and pharmaceutical-grade candidates will require sustained refinement of both computational algorithms and experimental validation frameworks.\n\n\nMethods\nThis method section provides technical details and extended analyses to support the results presented in the previous sections. The exposition is structured as follows:\n\nWet-lab experimental methods: experimental protocols for the binder identification pipeline and binder characterization workflow.\n\nDetails of the tFold system workflow: pre-wet-lab components of the tFold system workflow, including inputs, the application of a generator and filters, and the overall process.\n\nDatasets and evaluation criteria: dataset composition and detailed specifications of evaluation metrics.\n\nAdditional algorithmic details, including notations and conventions, algorithmic details, application details and supplementary results, are provided in the Supplementary information.\n\n\nAntigen and epitope for de novo design\nInfluenza A hemagglutinin protein (Flu A), a homotrimeric surface glycoprotein, mediates viral entry through receptor binding and membrane fusion. We selected the HA1 subunit of H3N2 (A/Aichi/2/ 1968) as our target antigen, focusing on the 220-loop (residues (219?; 220?; 221?; 222?; 223?; 224?; 225?; 226?; 227?; 228?; 229?)) at the trimer interface. Our antibody design aims to mimic the FluA-20 epitope (Unknown 2025es) in the non-receptor binding site region to achieve broad protection against diverse Flu A subtypes. (Sino Biological, REF:11707-V08H).\nProgrammed cell death (Unknown 2025a) (PD-1), a type I transmembrane glycoprotein in the CD28/CTLA-4 family, negatively regulates T-cell activation by recruiting SHP-2 upon binding to its ligands PD-L1 or PD-L2. We targeted the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction interface to block their binding and prevent immune evasion by tumors. (Sino Biological, REF:10377-H08H).\nProgrammed death-ligand (Unknown 2025a) (PD-L1), a cell-surface receptor that interacts with PD-1, plays a key role in immune regulation and tumor immune escape. Our antibody design focused on the PD-L1/PD-1 binding interface to disrupt this immunosuppressive interaction. (Sino Biological, REF:10084-H08H).\nSARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (SC2RBD), a protein domain required for COVID-19 infection, mediates viral entry by specifically binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme (Unknown 2025dh) (ACE2) receptor. We focused on the wild-type SC2RBD, targeting its RBD/ACE2 interaction interface to block viral attachment and prevent host cell infection. (Sino Biological, REF:40592-V08H).\n\n\nDe novo designed phage display library construction\nThe oligonucleotides encoding the designed antibodies were synthesized by Twist Bioscience as multiplexed gene fragments and 300- nucleotide (nt) single-stranded oligo pools, which included (Unknown 2025b),000 distinct variable heavy (VH) chain fragments and (Unknown 2025b),000 distinct variable light (VL) chain fragment. The libraries for different targets are different. Using these synthetic antibody gene pools as templates, VH and VL chain fragments were amplified via PCR. The VH and VL fragments were then assembled into single-chain variable fragment (scFv)-encoding sequences using splicing by overlap extension PCR (SOE-PCR), where the VL fragment is followed by the VH fragment and connected via a flexible linker with the sequence: SSGGGGSGGGGGGSSRSS. The resulting scFv sequences were digested with an in-house prepared SfiI restriction enzyme and ligated into the phage display vector pComb 3x. The ligated products were electroporated into X-Blue competent cells to construct the phage-displayed scFv antibody library. The library size was calculated to ensure sufficient diversity for downstream screening. Agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed that the constructed phage antibody library exhibited a library size consistent with the project requirements, thereby validating its suitability for subsequent screening processes.\nBinder identification with phage display and Sanger sequencing The primary antibody library was infected with helper phage to generate the initial phage-displayed antibody library. Enrichment of antigen-specific binders was performed through two distinct strategies: solid-phase panning and liquid-phase panning. For solid-phase panning, antigens were immobilized on ELISA plates. The presubtracted phage library (pre-adsorbed against His-tagged protein to minimize nonspecific binding) was added to the wells, followed by washing to remove unbound phages. Antigen-bound phages were eluted using acidic glycine buffer \\(\\left( \\mathsf { p H } \\ 2 . 2 \\right)\\) and neutralized immediately. In liquid-phase panning, biotinylated antigens were captured on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. The pre-subtracted phage library was incubated with the antigen-bead complexes, and unbound phages were removed via magnetic separation and washing. Bound phages were eluted under the same conditions as in solid-phase panning.\nEnriched phage pools from each round were amplified in , E. coliprecipitated, and subjected to subsequent rounds of panning ((Unknown 2025dh, 2025ds, 2025ed) rounds total). To mitigate cross-reactivity with His-tagged proteins, a subtractive pre-adsorption step was systematically incorporated before each panning cycle: the phage library was pre-incubated with His-tagged protein-coated plates or beads to deplete nonspecific binders.\nFollowing the final enrichment round, individual phage clones were picked and expressed for screening. Antigen-binding activity was evaluated by ELISA, with His-tagged protein serving as a negative control to exclude clones exhibiting cross-reactivity. A total of 1000 monoclonal phages testing positive in ELISA (defined by \\(0 { \\Delta } [@4; @5] 0 \\geq [@3] \\times\\) negative control) were selected for further characterization. These ELISA-positive clones were categorized by their target antigens (FluA, PD-1, PD-L1, and SC2RBD) and subjected to Sanger sequencing to assess sequence diversity.\nSequencing revealed distinct scFv sequences across antigens: 346 unique scFv sequences for Flu A, 591 for PD-1, 344 for PD-L1, and 540 for SC2RBD (summing to more than 1000 due to overlapping clone analysis across antigens). To further evaluate structural diversity, we analyzed the heavy chain sequences within these scFvs (with heavy\nchains, especially CDR-H3, playing a key role in epitope recognition), identifying 281 unique heavy chains for Flu A, 154 for PD-1, 247 for PD-L1, and 442 for SC2RBD.\nHigh-affinity clones demonstrating specific binding to the target antigen (but not to His-tag) were prioritized for downstream analysis. Ten antibodies were ultimately selected for further analysis from these unique scFv sequences, with preference given to clones showing strong ELISA signals and diverse heavy chain profiles to ensure representativeness.\n\n\nAntibody construction and HEK293 transient expression\nThe variable heavy (VH) and light (VL) chain fragments of scFv antibodies were amplified by PCR and purified using a membrane-binding buffer system. Purified fragments were ligated into the cloning vector with ligase at \\(5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }\\) for (Unknown 2025di) min, followed by transformation into competent cells via ice incubation (30 min) and heat shock (90 s). Colonies were expanded and sequenced to confirm scFv sequences. Validated heavy/light chain plasmid pairs with the Fc region were co-transfected into HEK293 cells using transfection reagent TF2. Transfected cells were cultured in serum-free CD medium supplemented with feed medium on days (Unknown 2025a), 3, and (Unknown 2025eo) post-transfection, under conditions of (Unknown 2025ea) °C, 5% CO2, and 175 rpm shaking.\n\n\nAntibody purification and quality analysis\nCell supernatants were clarified by centrifugation \\(( 4 0 0 0 \\times g ,\\) 30 min) and filtered through \\(0 . [@4; @5] \\mu \\mathrm { m }\\) g membranes. Clarified samples were loaded onto protein A columns pre-equilibrated with AC Binding buffer. After washing ((Unknown 2025eo, 2025ey, 2025fj, 2025fu, 2025gf, 2025b) column volumes, CV), antibodies were eluted with AC Elution buffer, neutralized with Tris \\(\\left( \\mathsf { p H [@8] } . 0 \\right)\\) , and dialyzed. Columns were regenerated with CIP buffer (&gt;5 CV), rinsed to neutrality, and stored in \\([@2; @5] \\%\\) ethanol.\nAntibody concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at \\([@2; @8] 0 \\mathsf { n m }\\) (baseline stability: \\(_ { \\pm 0 . 0 [@1] 5 ) }\\) ) and normalized using an IgG extinction coefficient (1.414). Purity was assessed via SDS-PAGE: samples \\(( 5 \\mu \\mathrm { g } )\\) were denatured in \\(4 \\times\\) loading buffer, electrophoresed at \\(\\bf { 1 0 0 V }\\) (stacking gel) and 140 V (separation gel), and stained with Coomassie blue.\n\n\nELISA for antibody binding analysis\nMicrotiter plates were coated overnight at \\(4 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }\\) with antigen protein (0.1 or \\(1 \\mu \\mathrm { g } / \\mathrm { m L }\\) , 100 μL/well). After removing the coating solution, plates were blocked with \\(2 \\%\\) BSA \\(( 3 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { L } / \\ w \\mathrm { e l l } )\\) for (Unknown 2025a) h at room temperature. Unbound blockers were removed by washing twice with 300 μL/well of wash buffer, followed by thorough drying. Test antibodies (1 μg/mL, 100 μL/well) were added and incubated for (Unknown 2025dh) h at room temperature. Plates were washed three times with wash buffer, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG \\(\\left( \\mathsf { H } + \\mathsf { L } \\right)\\) secondary antibody (100 μL/well at optimal dilution) was added for (Unknown 2025a) h. After repeating the wash step, chromogenic substrates A and B were mixed (1:1 ratio) and added to each well \\(( 2 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { L } / \\mathrm { w e l l } )\\) . The reaction proceeded for (Unknown 2025di) min at room temperature in the dark before termination with \\(5 0 \\mu \\mathrm { l }\\) /well stop solution. Absorbance at \\([@4; @5] 0 \\mathsf { n m }\\) (OD450) was measured immediately.\n\n\nAffinity assays using SPR\nBinding affinities were assessed on a Biacore (Unknown 2025fu) K instrument (Cytiva) with S-series Protein A or NTA chips (Cytiva).

Solution A included ACE2 protein \\(( 5 0 0 \\mathsf { n M } )\\) and buffer. Solution B contained ACE2 protein, SC2RBD antibodies \\(( [@3; @3] . 3 \\mathsf { n M } )\\) ), and buffer. The injection was at \\(3 0 \\mu \\mathrm { L / m i n }\\) for (Unknown 2025gg) s, followed by 300 s of dissociation. The four experimental modes were: (1) SC2RBD, ACE2, and SC2RBD antibody; (2) SC2RBD, buffer, and SC2RBD antibody; (3) SC2RBD, ACE2, and additional ACE2; (4) SC2RBD, buffer, and buffer.

Solution A consisted of FluA-20 \\(( 2 0 0 \\mathsf { n M } )\\) and buffer. Solution B had FluA-20, Flu A antibodies \\(( 2 0 0 \\mathsf { n M } )\\) , and buffer. The injection was at \\(3 0 \\mu \\mathrm { L / m i n }\\) for (Unknown 2025gg) s, followed by 300 s of dissociation.

The chips were regenerated using \\(1 0 \\mathrm { m M }\\) Glycine-HCl (pH (Unknown 2025dh).0) at \\(3 0 \\mu \\mathrm { L / m i n }\\) for (Unknown 2025dt) s.\n\n\nDetails of candidate antibodies selection with tFold system\nInputs for the tFold system. The input for the tFold system includes the antigen MSA, antigen epitope, and antibody template. We utilized the IGHV3-23/IGKV1-5 and IGHJ4/IGKJ1 antibody templates, which are humanized to avoid the need for further humanization steps. The lengths of the antibody CDRs are manually specified: CDR-1 and CDR-2 are determined by the V gene and have fixed lengths, while the length of CDR-3 is variable. To determine the CDR-3 lengths, we analyzed antibodies with the same V gene in the OAS database and selected the (Unknown 2025dz) most frequent combinations (12 for CDR-H3 and (Unknown 2025ds) for CDR-L3). The sequence and length composition of the antibody templates are detailed in Table (Unknown 2025a).\nGenerator and filter. This section delineates the details of tFold system workflow we used before wet-lab experimental. It integrates multi-\nphase generation and hierarchical filtering strategies to produce de novo antibodies target specific antigen epitope.\n\nData expansion and model fine-tuning. We expanded the training dataset by fine-tuning our generator (tFold-Ag-ppi) using epitopespecific antibody data from the SAbDab database prior to 2024. This approach excluded paratope information to enhance the model’s generalizability, particularly improving structural prediction performance for SCRBD antibodies.\n\nCandidate antibody generation. For each target, tFold-Ag-ppi generated approximately (Unknown 2025a) million distinct candidate antibodies using 1000 random seeds and (Unknown 2025dz) FR inputs (Table (Unknown 2025a)). During generation, sequence positions were iteratively selected based on iplddt scores, while temperature sampling was applied to increase diversity in CDR sequences (especially CDR1 and CDR2).\n\nStructure prediction and initial filtering. Antibody-antigen complex structures were predicted using tFold-Ag and AlphaFold-Multimer. The top \\(20 \\%\\) of candidates were selected based on confidence score distributions \\(( { \\geq } 0 . 7 )\\) . These complexes were structurally aligned with antigen templates, and candidates exhibiting steric clashes between the antibody and the receptor (or ligand) were retained, while the others were filtered out. This filtering strategy was designed to enrich for antibodies capable of blocking the binding of the receptor to the antigen, a critical functional requirement for therapeutic candidates.\n\nSequence novelty filtering. Candidates with excessive similarity to known positive antibodies were removed using edit distance thresholds: dist-CDRH \\({ \\geq } 4\\) , dist-CDRL \\({ \\geq } 4\\) , dist-CDRH3 \\({ \\geq } 3 _ { i }\\) , dist-CDRL3 \\(^ { \\ge [@3] }\\) . For PD1 targets, the CDR-H3 threshold was relaxed to \\(^ { \\ge [@2] }\\) .\n\nUnnatural motif filtering. Artificial repetitive motifs with occurrence frequencies below \\(0 . 0 [@1] \\%\\) in OAS CDR sequences were systematically excluded. Prohibited patterns included “EEEEE”, “EEGEE”, “GGGGG”, “YYYYY”, and similar low-frequency sequences.\n\nSpecificity scoring and sampling. An upgraded in-house antibodyantigen specificity prediction algorithm (derived from A (Unknown 2025dh)binder (Unknown 2025cl)) scored all antibody-antigen pairs. The top 2000 scoring sequences were directly selected, while the remaining candidates underwent weighted random sampling (based on specificity scores) to complete a total of (Unknown 2025b),000 pairs per target.\n\nFinal output: this workflow generated (Unknown 2025b),000 paired heavy and light chain antibodies per target, optimized for structural stability, diversity, and antigen specificity.\n\n\n\nDataset and evaluation criteria\nDatasets for antibody structures prediction. We constructed the training, validation, and test sets from the SAbDab database (Unknown 2025dl) following the widely adopted temporally separated protocol (Unknown 2025dr) 58,. Specifically, we curated all experimentally determined antibody structures released before (Unknown 2025du) December 2021 to form the training set. This dataset comprises 8264 antibody complexes containing both heavy and light chains, 1693 antibody samples with only heavy chain information, and 376 antibody samples with only light chain information. We conducted meticulous data cleaning to remove structures with sequencestructure mismatches, non-standard amino acids, and incorrect heavy-light chain pairings.\nDuring training preparation, we clustered the samples using CD-\\({ \\mathsf { H i t } } ^ { [@8; @6] }\\) based on sequence similarity. Antibodies sharing \\([@5; @9] 5 \\%\\) sequence identity were grouped into the same cluster, yielding 2873 distinct clusters. For each training epoch, we randomly selected one representative sample from each cluster to assemble epoch-specific training data. The validation set contains antibody structures released between (Unknown 2025a) January 2022 and (Unknown 2025dt) June 2022, used for hyper-parameter tuning and model selection. We removed validation samples exhibiting \\([@5; @9] 5 \\%\\)\nsequence identity with training set counterparts to ensure independence. For evaluation, we established two non-redundant test subsets from structures released between (Unknown 2025a) July 2022 and (Unknown 2025du) December 2022: SAbDab-22H2-Ab (169 antibodies) and SAbDab-22H2-Nano (73 nanobodies), both maintaining \\(- [@9; @9] \\%\\) intra-set sequence identity. To rigorously assess mutation sensitivity, we further excluded test samples showing \\(100 \\%\\) sequence identity with training data. The comprehensive data curation pipeline ensured removal of problematic structures at all stages.\nDatasets for antibody–antigen complex prediction. Following a similar protocol, we constructed training, validation, and test sets for antibody-antigen complex structures using the SAbDab (Unknown 2025dl). The training set includes 4834 experimentally determined antibody-antigen complexes and 1319 nanobody–antigen complexes (encompassing singledomain antibody-antigen instances) released before (Unknown 2025du) December 2021. During training preparation, samples were clustered by antigen sequence similarity through CD-Hit (Unknown 2025gb), grouping complexes with \\([@5; @9] 5 \\%\\) antigen sequence identity into shared clusters. This process yielded 2459 distinct antigen clusters. For each training epoch, one representative sample was randomly selected per cluster to form epochspecific training data.\nThe validation set contains antibody-antigen and nanobody–antigen complexes released between (Unknown 2025a) January 2022 and (Unknown 2025dt) June 2022, consisting of (Unknown 2025gp) antibody–antigen and (Unknown 2025ee) nanobody–antigen complexes. The test set comprises (Unknown 2025gp) antibody–antigen and (Unknown 2025ef) nanobody–antigen complexes released from (Unknown 2025a) July 2022 to (Unknown 2025du) December 2022, organized into two non-redundant benchmarks: SAbDab-22H2-AbAg (antibody–antigen) and SAbDab-22H2-NanoAg (nanobody–antigen), both maintaining \\(- [@9; @5] \\%\\) intra-set sequence identity. To ensure fair benchmarking against existing methods like AlphaFold-Multimer, all test set structures were excluded during the training phase of all evaluated models. Additional test set pre-processing involved: (1) Removing samples sharing \\([@5; @9] 5 \\%\\) sequence identity with training set antigens; (2) Excluding antibody/ nanobody–antigen complexes lacking interfacial contacts; (3) Eliminating complexes with antigens exceeding 600 residues in length; (4) Removing samples with over \\(50 \\%\\) missing residues in the antibody and nanobody structure. Consistent with our data curation pipeline, we rigorously applied quality filters to remove mismatched sequences, atypical amino acids, and erroneous chain configurations across all datasets. This protocol ensures temporal separation, structural integrity, and low redundancy for robust evaluation of generalization capabilities.\nFor each antigen chain in SAbDab, we produced its MSA by executing MMseqs (Unknown 2025dh) following the default ColabFold pipeline. This was performed on the UniRef 3087 library of March 2021, and the colabfold_envdb (Unknown 2025gd) as of August, 2021.\nDatasets for virtual screening of binding antibodies. To assess tFold-Ag’s efficacy in high-throughput binding antibody screening, we established two antigen-specific test sets: one targeting PD-1 and the other focusing on the wild-type SC2RBD.\nThis PD-1 set evaluates tFold-Ag’s ability to discriminate therapeutic anti-PD-1 antibodies from non-targeted antibodies. It comprises:\n• 27 anti-PD-1 therapeutic antibodies curated from Thera-SAbDab (Unknown 2025ea) (WHO-listed therapeutics with publicly available sequences).\n• 718 paired heavy-light chain antibodies from healthy donors via \\({ \\mathsf { O A S } } ^ { [@3; @3] }\\) , originally sampled during human rhinovirus infection studies (Unknown 2025ge).\nTo prevent evaluation bias, we excluded nine therapeutic antibodies with existing experimental structures that might have been used in model training. The final benchmark contains 745 sequences,\nrequiring tFold-Ag to identify the (Unknown 2025dp) therapeutics using sequence data alone.\nSimulating real-world drug discovery, this SC2RBD set leverages single-B cell repertoire sequencing data from SARS-CoV-2 spikeimmunized mice (Unknown 2025fp) via OAS33:\n• Initial pool: 11,388 paired heavy-light chain antibodies.\n• After quality control: removal of 125 antibodies with incomplete VH/VL domains.\n• Post-deduplication: 1595 unique antibodies with distinct VH/VL sequences, none having structural entries in SAbDab.\nFunctional annotations include:\n• 85 RBD binders and (Unknown 2025fm) ACE2 blockers identified through ELISA and biolayer interferometry (BLI).\n• Clonal relationships to characterized antibodies confirmed via germline gene identifiers and CDR3 sequence alignment.\ntFold-Ag was tasked with distinguishing RBD binders from the 1595- sequence pool using only sequence inputs. Given the imbalance in this dataset (with non-binders vastly outnumbering binders), our evaluation incorporates not only AUC-ROC but also enrichment factors to robustly assess performance, ensuring a comprehensive quantification of its ability to prioritize true binders amid class imbalance.\nDatasets for CDRs recovery. To comprehensively evaluate our model’s generalizability across diverse antibodies and antigens, we established two specialized test sets: one for antigen generalization and the other for antibody generalization.\nThe first benchmark, SAbDab-22-DesignAb, was curated from SAbDab by selecting antigen sequences clustered at 70% sequence identity. It contains antibody-antigen complexes released between (Unknown 2025a) January 2022 and (Unknown 2025du) December 2022. We excluded complexes where antigens shared \\(&gt; 70\\%\\) sequence identity with training set antigens. We further filtered out structures with experimental resolutions \\(&gt; 2.5 \\text{ Å}\\) to maintain structural reliability. For design relevance, we retained only complexes where CDR-H3 regions requiring design made antigen contacts (interatomic distance \\(&lt; 10 \\text{ Å}\\)). This yielded (Unknown 2025ep) high-quality antibody-antigen structures. Leveraging their experimental structures, we extracted critical input features including PPI interfaces, antigen epitopes, and contact details. This benchmark evaluates CDRs recovery performance under diverse antigen contexts with experimentally validated inputs.\nThe second benchmark, Cov-AbDab-DesignAb, was derived from Cov-AbDab (Unknown 2025ec), containing coronavirus-binding antibodies. We removed antibodies with \\(100 \\%\\) sequence identity to training set antigens and clustered antibody sequences at \\(70 \\%\\) identity, resulting in (Unknown 2025fr) nonredundant antibody–antigen pairs. Notably, Cov-AbDab focuses on coronavirus-targeting antibodies, leading to antigen sequence homogeneity. This cluster-based curation enables systematic assessment of antibody framework generalization. As most Cov-AbDab entries lack experimental structures, we employed AlphaFold2 to predict antigen structures for methods requiring structural inputs.\nWe excluded the widely used RAbD (Unknown 2025at) benchmark, as its constituent antibody-antigen complexes overlap with our training data. While our method extends to nanobody design, the absence of comparable baselines prompted us to create SAbDab-22-DesignNano (detailed in the Supplementary Information) for internal validation. This benchmark follows analogous curation principles to SAbDab-22- DesignAb, with results presented in Supplementary Information to maintain focus on antibody CDRs recovery evaluation. Consistent with our data preprocessing pipeline, all datasets underwent rigorous filtering to remove sequence-structure mismatches, noncanonical residues, and erroneous chain configurations. The temporal separation between training (pre-2022) and evaluation (2022 releases) data ensures unbiased assessment of generalization capabilities.\nEvaluation criteria. For antibody structure prediction, we present the backbone root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) for various FRs and CDRs. We use Chothia (Unknown 2025gg), a structure-based numbering scheme for antibody variable regions. Additionally, we compare \\(\\mathrm { O C D } ^ { [@6; @2] }\\) and DockQ (Unknown 2025gh) score to verify how well the relative position between heavy and light chains is estimated.\n\n\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n\nData availability\nAll input data are freely available from public sources.

Fitzgerald & Nimish Gera (2024) Biparatopic antibodies: therapeutic applications and prospects, mAbs, 16:1, 2310890, DOI: 10.1080/19420862.2024.2310890\n\n\nABSTRACT\nBiparatopic antibodies (bpAbs) bind distinct, non-overlapping epitopes on an antigen. This unique binding mode enables new mechanisms of action beyond monospecific and bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) that can make bpAbs effective therapeutics for various indications, including oncology and infectious diseases. Biparatopic binding can lead to superior affinity and specificity, promote antagonism, lock target conformation, and result in higher-order target clustering. Such antibody-target complexes can elicit strong agonism, increase immune effector function, or result in rapid target downregulation and lysosomal trafficking. These are not only attractive properties for therapeutic antibodies but are increasingly being explored for other modalities such as antibody-drug conjugates, T-cell engagers and chimeric antigen receptors. Recent advances in bpAb engineering have enabled the construction of ever more sophisticated formats that are starting to show promise in the clinic.\n\n\nKEYWORDS\nAntibody engineering; antibody-drug conjugates; biparatopic antibodies; bispecific antibodies; chimeric antigen receptors; infectious disease; oncology; T-cell engagers\n\n\nIntroduction\nAntibody therapies accounted for \\(3 [@0] \\%\\) of the novel drug approvals in the US in 2022 (n.d.a). Of the antibodies in development, a marked increase in the number of highly engineered molecules, including bispecific antibodies (bsAbs), has been observed (n.d.b). Biparatopic antibodies (bpAbs) are a subset of bsAbs having specificity for unique, non-overlapping epitopes on the same molecular target. This unique binding mode, established more than 30 years ago, enables differentiated mechanisms of action (MoAs)(n.d.c). Over the past decade, the therapeutic potential of bpAbs has become evident with the first successes in clinical trials. These pioneering molecules have paved the way for an increasing number of bpAbs in clinical development today (Table 1). This review provides an overview of the diverse formats and MoAs, the current clinical pipeline, and prospects of bpAbs.\n\n\nBiparatopic formats\nAdvances in antibody discovery and engineering enable increasingly sophisticated bpAb formats that assemble binding domains against distinct epitopes in diverse architectures. The choice of format depends on the target biology and proposed MoA. Critical design considerations include the targeted epitopes, the number and nature of individual binding domains, the addition of half-life extension and effector functionmediating domains, and the strategy to ensure correct assembly of all domains into a functional bpAb. The latter can be as simple as concatenating individual domains with flexible linkers in a single protein or, in crystallizable fragment (Fc) domain containing bpAbs, depend on the correct pairing of up to four distinct proteins with corresponding steering\nmutations in the heavy chains (HCs) and light chains (LCs), respectively. Productive epitope pairs are hard to predict rationally or with antibody mixtures. Therefore, the ability to efficiently generate and screen large matrices of epitope pairs in a given bpAb format is key (n.d.d). Beyond functionality and feasibility, developability considerations are crucial when selecting a bpAb format. Testing for biophysical liabilities of bpAbs early on can mitigate the risk of failure in animal studies and clinical trials (n.d.e). Similarly, the choice of bpAb format can affect downstream manufacturing and quality control due to poor developability or mispaired side products that may result from bpAb format complexity (n.d.f).\nThe bpAbs tested in the clinic to date not only feature diverse formats, but also draw on a large diversity of individual binding domains (Figure 1). Single-chain antibody formats, such as single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) and single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) in particular, are readily paired in biparatopic formats. Accordingly, the two first bpAbs to enter the clinic, \\(\\mathrm { A L X }  – 0 [@6] [@5; @1] ^ { 7 }\\) and BI 1034020 (n.d.g) consist of tandem sdAbs. Antibody fragment-based bpAbs typically exhibit a short half-life in circulation and require further engineering to improve exposure. The small size makes sdAbs ideal building blocks for chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), as highlighted by the biparatopic CAR-T therapies ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel)(n.d.h) and OriCAR-017 (n.d.i)\nThe majority of bpAbs tested in the clinic to date have a more canonical, Fc-containing architecture that can be classified by the symmetry across the HC axis (Figure 1). Symmetric bpAbs consist of identical HC or HC/LC pairs while asymmetric molecules consist of disparate halves with different binding domains. The tetravalent molecules MEDI4276 and BAT2022 are examples of symmetric bpAbs\n\n\n\nTable 1: Biparatopic antibodies in the clinic.

Analogous to KN060, trispecific TAVO412 achieves biparatopic targeting with a tandem sdAb arm that is embedded in a more complex asymmetric format (n.d.l). Asymmetric bpAbs typically rely on Fc mutations to either facilitate purification of the bpAb product or guide heterodimer formation. The two HCs of REGN5093, for example, are engineered to exhibit different affinity for protein A and allow\npurification of the heterodimer product (n.d.m).,16 GEN3009 on the other hand, is an asymmetric bpAb with Fc domain steering mutations that ensure the correct pairing of the two distinct HCs (n.d.n). In addition to HC heterodimerization, correct LC pairing can be a challenge for asymmetric bpAbs. In the example of GEN3009, correct pairing is achieved via a mild in vitro reaction from two parent antibodies that allows HC recombination without scrambling of the original LC pairing. An alternative strategy that avoids the LC pairing problem altogether is illustrated by REGN5093, which consists of two disparate HCs paired with two identical LCs.

(e) Alternatively, receptor and Fc domain clustering by bpAb binding in trans can result in fast internalization and lysosomal trafficking or strong effector function, in particular complement-dependent cytotoxicity.\n\n\n\nLCs can be derived directly from discovery platforms with defined LC diversity as in the example of REGN5093, or engineered from existing LCs as in anbenitamab and GR2002 (n.d.o).–20 ISB \\([@1; @4] [@4; @2] ^ { [@2; @1] }\\) and \\(\\mathrm { S A R } [@4; @4] [@1; @2] [@3; @6] ^ { [@2; @2] }\\) are examples of asymmetric bpAbs that expand the immunoglobulin G (IgG) architecture with additional Fab or scFv domains, respectively, to achieve higher valency and even triparatopic binding in the case of SAR441236. Smaller asymmetric formats such as the fragment-Fab-based zanidatamab (n.d.p) or the fragment–fragment-based TNB-73824 \\([@7; @3] 8 ^ { [@2; @4] }\\) can be exploited as well. Zanidatamab pairs an scFv domain with a full Fab arm while TNB-738 derives its binding arms from two sdAbs with an inert LC added for manufacturability. Beyond the immunoglobulin fold, a biparatopic designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin), MP0274, highlights the potential of alternative scaffolds (n.d.q). A comprehensive review of all bispecific formats is covered by Labrijn et al. 26.\n\n\nMoAs of bpAbs\n\n\nBiparatopic targeting enables enhanced binding through avidity\nBinding to two distinct, non-overlapping epitopes on the same target results in unique properties of bpAbs compared to other antibodies. Many bpAbs show superior binding and slower dissociation from the target compared to their monoparatopic parent antibodies. This is a result of avid binding to two distinct epitopes either on the same (cis) or different (trans) target molecules (Figure 2 (a)). Avidity is defined as the combination of multiple noncovalent interactions by a single molecule and the associated increase in likelihood of binding and rebinding events once the first interaction is established (n.d.r). Antibody fragments targeting distinct epitopes can be linked to increase target affinity via avidity as highlighted by the\nsdAb-based, clinically evaluated bpAbs ALX-0651 and BI 1034020 (n.d.s, n.d.g, n.d.t, n.d.u, n.d.v, n.d.w) Dissociation of bpAbs can be drastically slower compared to mono- or bivalent monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) making them superior antagonists (n.d.x) 33, or inverse agonists (n.d.s).,34 Cis binding to form a 1:1 bpAb target complex can be important for such applications to avoid unwanted agonist activity (n.d.y). In addition to epitope selection, geometrical arrangement of binding domains, sdAb linker optimization, and affinity tuning can be crucial to achieve the desired MoA and maximize efficacy. Kast and colleagues demonstrated that geometry of the binding domains was crucial for human epidermal growth factor receptor (n.d.b) (HER2) antagonism of biparatopic and tetravalent fusion proteins with certain configurations showing agonist activity (n.d.z). Similarly, different architectures of triparatopic anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) IgG-fibronectin fusions showed varied efficacy in receptor downregulation (n.d.aa). For sdAb-based antagonists, optimal orientation and linker properties can enable ultra-high affinity by avid binding in cis (n.d.w).,38 Finally, the clinical bpAb ISB 1442 relies on careful tuning of the CD38 and CD47 affinities to reduce on-target toxicity. The anti-CD47 Fab of ISB 1442 has been engineered for weak affinity to achieve minimal reactivity with CD47-positive red blood cells. A high-affinity, biparatopic, anti-CD38 arm enables avid target engagement and high specificity on CD38-low tumor cells (n.d.ab).\nThe high affinity and slow dissociation of bpAbs is also attractive for recruitment of immune cells. For example, Liu and coworkers engineered a T cell engaging anti-HER2 bpAb by fusing two sdAbs targeting non-overlapping epitopes with an anti-CD3 Fab (n.d.ac). The resulting construct showed a 30-fold increase in binding on HER2-positive cells compared to the corresponding monoparatopic parent molecules and superior tumor suppression activity in vivo in a HER2-low expressing model. Similarly, Rennert et al. engineered a biparatopic bridging protein against C-type lectin domain family (n.d.ad) member A (CLEC12A) that is secreted by and recruits anti-CD19 CAR-T cells (n.d.ae). The high affinity enabled by biparatopic targeting resulted in increased anti-CD19 CAR-T cell cytotoxicity. Due to the small size of sdAbs, CARs can be equipped directly with bpAbs as highlighted by cilta-cel (n.d.h) and OriCAR-017 (n.d.i) The high affinity biparatopic binding of such CARs can result in enhanced and sustained efficacy (n.d.af). As discussed above for sdAb-based antagonists, careful selection of epitopes and linker optimization can be key.\n\n\nbpAbs enable dual pathway inhibition and can lock the conformation of receptors and ectoenzymes\nBinding to two non-overlapping epitopes can unlock unique activities for bpAbs. Dual-pathway inhibition, for example, was achieved with a bpAb-targeting low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (n.d.f) (LRP6) to simultaneously block both Wnt 1- and Wnt 3a-mediated \\(\\beta\\) -catenin signaling pathways, notably without agonist activity (Figure 2 (b))(n.d.ag). Alternatively, bpAbs can inactivate their targets by physically constraining them. The crystal structure of a biparatopic anti-\nHER2 DARPin targeting subdomains I and IV revealed binding and distortion of two HER2 receptors that prevented the formation of signaling-competent dimers with EGFR family members (n.d.ah). Furthermore, bpAbs against CD38 and CD73, including the clinical bpAb TNB-738, were shown to act as enzyme inhibitors by locking the respective extracellular domains in catalytically inactive states (Figure 2 (c))(n.d.ai).,44,45 Whereas individual parent antibodies did not show any activity, anti-CD73 bpAbs had sub-nanomolar activity and achieved \\(&gt; 9 [@0] \\%\\) inhibition (n.d.aj).\n\n\nbpAbs can form immunocomplexes that result in agonism, rapid target internalization, lysosomal trafficking and improved immune effector function\nA unique feature of bpAbs is their ability to form higher-order immunocomplexes by engaging two non-overlapping epitopes simultaneously in trans. Target crosslinking is the basis for multiple MoAs, including enhanced agonism, Fc-mediated effector function or clearance of soluble targets, and receptor downregulation.\nClustering by bpAbs can promote agonism, in particular for receptors that rely on cross-linking for efficient downstream signaling (Figure 2 (d)). Members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF), for example, are important therapeutic targets due to their role in immune regulation and cell proliferation. TNFRSFtargeted mAbs typically rely on Fc receptor-mediated higher-order clustering, which has stymied their therapeutic application. Yang and coworkers have recently shown that tetravalent bpAbs against the TNFRSF members OX40 and death receptor (n.d.e) (DR5) achieve robust intrinsic agonism that is superior to extrinsically cross-linked parent mAbs, highlighting the potential of bpAb agonists (n.d.ak). BpAbs may also be uniquely positioned to activate multicomponent receptor complexes. For example, Shi et al. engineered a bpAb targeting two distinct epitopes of \\(\\beta .\\) - klotho, the co-receptor of fibroblast growth receptor 1c (FGFR1c)(n.d.al). Biparatopic targeting was both necessary and sufficient to elicit potent agonism.\nReceptor clustering by bpAbs increases the local concentration of Fc domains and can thereby lead to improved effector function (Figure 2 (e)). This effect has been observed with multivalent complexes targeted by mAbs, for example the B-cell marker CD20 targeted by the therapeutic mAb rituximab (n.d.am). Biparatopic binding by the antibody can extend this MoA to more targets. The formation of a large HER2 cluster by zanidatamab, for example, was shown to result in more potent complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) compared to a combination of the parent mAbs due to Fc domain preorganization and the resulting increase in C (n.d.a)q deposition (n.d.p). This effect was further amplified for the anti-CD37 bpAb GEN3009 by introduction of a hexamerization enhancing point mutation in the Fc domain (n.d.n). Although less pronounced, Fc clustering by bpAbs has been shown to additionally improve antibodydependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) by increasing binding to FcγRIII receptors on natural killer (NK) cells (n.d.an). Analogously, cluster formation by an anti-interleukin (n.d.f) (IL6)\nbpAb was used to increase Fcγ receptor binding on phagocytic cells and promote rapid clearance of the soluble target (n.d.ao).\nCross-linked receptor rafts have been shown to be quickly internalized and trafficked to the lysosome resulting in rapid target downregulation (Figure 2 (e))(n.d.m).,23,36,(n.d.ap, n.d.aq, n.d.ar, n.d.as) Of note, the cross-linking efficiency and the associated effects can be dependent on epitope selection as well as bpAb:target geometry (n.d.z). Fast internalization and lysosomal trafficking make bpAbs increasingly popular building blocks for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) where they drive the tumor delivery and intracellular release of cytotoxic payloads as shown for MEDI4276, REGN5093-M114, and zanidatamab zovodotin (n.d.j).,(n.d.at, n.d.au, n.d.av) Compared to monoparatopic agents, the biparatopic anti-folate receptor alpha (FRα) ADC IMGN151 exhibits superior payload delivery (n.d.aw). As this effect is independent of FRα density on the cell surface, it has been speculated that the increase in payload delivery by IMGN151 is a result of boosting the binding events on FRα positive cells rather than clustering, which should reduce with receptor density. However, these two MoAs are not mutually exclusive and further studies will be required to elucidate the MoA of IMGN151.\n\n\nSimultaneous engagement of distinct epitopes can overcome resistance mechanisms\nA common challenge in treating viral infections is to find a broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) that binds a conserved region of the coat protein and results in a durable response. Monospecific antibodies can target conserved regions, but are susceptible to mutational escape as they place selective pressure on the virus. Similar in principle to the use of cocktails of smallmolecule drugs, combinations of bnAbs have proven effective in reducing monotherapy resistance by decreasing the chances of single mutation escape variants (n.d.ax). Biparatopic bnAbs combine the clinical benefit of cocktails with the ease of use of single agent dosing, making them an exciting area for development (n.d.ad).,22,59,60 A biparatopic bnAb targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (n.d.b) (SARS-CoV-2), BAT2022, was shown to bind to all major variants of concern including a receptor-binding domain (RBD) mutant that was no longer recognized by one of the parental antibodies (n.d.ad). For HIV, the triparatopic bnAb SAR441236 and several preclinical molecules have shown promise by targeting multiple epitopes on viral coat proteins (n.d.ay).,59\nMultiparatopic targeting to prevent resistance may be clinically useful for tumor-associated antigen (TAA) targeting as well. Tumor cells can eliminate targeted epitopes, for example by alternative splicing. It has been speculated that biparatopic CAR-T cells can prevent tumor escape by targeting two epitopes simultaneously (n.d.az). While further mechanistic studies will be important, this is an interesting prospect for cancer immunotherapy. Although conceptually different, Spangler and colleagues demonstrated that triparatopic EGFR targeting could restore efficacy against cetuximab-resistant xenograft models with mutations in downstream signaling pathways (n.d.aa). The most effective triparatopic constructs achieved the necessary level of receptor downregulation that was not possible with bi- or monoparatopic constructs alone.\n\n\nTherapeutic applications and modalities\nTo date, the majority of bpAbs have been developed for oncology applications and, with cilta-cel, the first bpAb-based cell therapy has been approved for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (n.d.ba). A number of other bpAbs are currently in early clinical trials for hematological cancers, including ISB 1442 and OriCAR-017 which are both in Phase I for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (n.d.bb).,64.\nFor therapy of solid tumors, many bpAbs target the HER2 (n.d.j),,19,23,36,39,53,54,57,(n.d.bc, n.d.bd, n.d.be, n.d.bf, n.d.bg, n.d.bh) which is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is involved in various cellular functions including cell proliferation. High levels of HER2 overexpression are observed in \\(2 [@0] { - } [@2; @5] \\%\\) of breast cancer patients (n.d.bi).,72 Targeting two distinct HER2 epitopes with a combination of the clinical mAbs trastuzumab and pertuzumab that bind to the nonoverlapping domains IV and II, respectively, has previously been shown to lead to significantly improved treatment outcome and prognosis (n.d.bj).,74 The importance of HER2 and the clinical precedent for dual epitope targeting may explain the abundance of anti-HER2 bpAbs in the pipeline including anbenitamab and zanidatamab, the two most clinically advanced HER2-targeted bpAbs (n.d.b). Other prominent oncology targets are pursued with bpAbs as well, including mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) and FRα by REGN5093 (−M114) and IMGN151, respectively (n.d.m).,56,58\nBeyond oncology, the clinical candidates SAR441236 and BAT2022 highlight the potential of bpAbs in infectious disease. One challenge inhibiting the widespread implementation of bnAbs for acute infections is the emergence of escape variants, as illustrated during the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (n.d.bk). mAbs targeting a single epitope are only effective until mutational escape variants develop and become widespread, leaving established therapies ineffective. BnAbs against more than one epitope, such as the SARS-CoV-2-targeted bpAb BAT2022 or the HIV-targeted triparatopic antibody SAR441236, can overcome the emergence of single-mutant escape variants in both acute and chronic disease, allowing for sustained use and more durable patient responses (n.d.ad).,22\nMost clinical bpAbs function as naked antibodies to treat viral infections, inhibit or promote cell signaling via the respective receptor or, as in the case of TNB-738,24 by inhibiting enzymatic activity. Increasingly, bpAbs are used for payload delivery as part of ADCs (n.d.j) 23,,56 due to their unique MoAs that promote internalization and lysosomal trafficking, as discussed above. There are currently six biparatopic ADCs under clinical evaluation, with three of them also being investigated as naked bpAbs. Furthermore, the high affinity and selectivity of bpAbs are attractive for the engineering of efficient T cell recruiters and CAR s (n.d.ac).,40,62,63 In this section we discuss the architecture, MoAs and activity for bpAbs that have been or are being tested in the clinic for molecules where data is available.\n\n\nALX-0651\nAblynx’s ALX-0651, a biparatopic CXCR4-targeted tandem sdAb, was the first clinically used biologic against GPCRs and, to our knowledge, the first bpAb to enter the clinic (in 2011). While the individual sdAb building blocks for ALX-0651 showed neutral antagonist activity, biparatopic ALX-\n0651 not only exhibited higher affinity, but also showed inverse agonist activity against CXCR4 (n.d.s). Preclinical data suggested ALX-0651 was effective in blocking CXCR4-mediated viral entry as well as inducing rapid stem-cell mobilization. Although preclinical data supported development, ALX-0651 was discontinued due to lack of superiority to standard of care (n.d.g, n.d.bl)\n\n\nBI 1034020\nBI 1034020 is a biparatopic, half-life extended tandem sdAb developed by Ablynx and Boehringer Ingelheim. This bpAb targets two independent epitopes of amyloid beta (Aβ) in the brain and was intended for use in Alzheimer’s disease. A Phase I study of BI 1034020 started in 2013 but was discontinued after a drug-related serious adverse event (n.d.g).\n\n\nMEDI4276\nMEDI4276, an anti-HER2 ADC developed by Medimmune, entered the clinic in 2015. MEDI4276 consists of a tetravalent bpAb based on the trastuzumab scFv targeting domain IV fused N-terminally to the heavy chain of mAb 39S targeting domain II11. This bpAb delivers four sitespecifically conjugated tubulysin payloads to HER2 overexpressing tumor cells where the ADC is internalized and trafficked to the lysosome to release the cytotoxic payload. In contrast to the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab, MEDI4276 can crosslink receptors resulting in rapid internalization and efficient cytoplasmic delivery by redirecting HER2 trafficking from recycling to lysosomal degradation (n.d.at). Xenograft tumor models showed that MEDI4276 was highly efficacious against HER2 low tumors as well as tumors resistant to ado-trastuzumab emtansine, thus addressing a high unmet medical need (n.d.j). In a Phase I dose-escalation study MEDI4276 showed clinical activity in HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers, but was ultimately discontinued due to an unfavorable toxicity profile (n.d.bm).\n\n\nCiltacabtagene autoleucel\nCiltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel) is, to our knowledge, the first and only approved bpAb-based therapy to date. Originally developed by Legend Biotech as LCAR-B38M, cilta-cel is a second-generation autologous CAR-T therapy featuring a biparatopic ectodomain with two sdAbs that target distinct epitopes on B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)(n.d.bn). Biparatopic targeting enables higher affinity binding and superior efficacy compared to monoparatopic constructs. Cilta-cel was approved in 2022 based on the CARTITUDE-1 Phase Ib/II study (NCT03548207) that demonstrated deep and durable responses with a manageable safety profile (n.d.ba). The overall response rate of \\([@9; @7] . 9 \\%\\) was even higher than the \\([@8; @7] . 8 \\%\\) observed in the initial Phase I study (NCT03090659)(n.d.bo). Interestingly, the approval of cilta-cel follows only (n.d.a) year after the approval of idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel), a comparable CAR-T therapy with monoparatopic BCMA targeting. While the respective clinical trials should be compared with caution, biparatopic cilta-cel appears to be superior to monoparatopic ide-cel in both response rate and duration of response (n.d.ba)\n\n\nZanidatamab and zanidatamab zovodotin\nDerived from Zymeworks’ proprietary Azymetric Fc platform, the bpAb zanidatamab (ZW25) combines a HER2 domain IVtargeting scFv with a Fab arm recognizing domain II23. Zanidatamab binds two molecules of HER2 in trans, inducing distinct receptor reorganization on the cell membrane. In addition to rapid internalization and downregulation, the clustering of Fc domains elicits strong CDC that is not observed for either trastuzumab, pertuzumab or their combination. Biparatopic HER2 engagement resulted in superior antitumor activity in an in vivo xenograft model compared to the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Zanidatamab was shown to be safe in patients with a range of tumors with various HER2-expression levels (n.d.bp). Zanidatamab is currently being investigated in multiple clinical trials including a Phase II trial for breast cancer (NCT04224272) and a Phase III trial for advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas (NCT05152147). Zanidatamab is also being explored for the delivery of a cytotoxic tubulin inhibitor (n.d.av). This biparatopic ADC, zanidatamab zovodotin (ZW49), has been shown to be a strong inducer of hallmarks of immunogenic cell death and was highly active against breast and gastric cancer patientderived xenograft models with a range of HER2 expression. A Phase I clinical trial is currently ongoing (NCT03821233).\n\n\nMP0274\nDeveloped by Molecular Partners, MP0274 achieves biparatopic HER2-targeting with DARPins, alternative scaffolds that can be concatenated like beads on a string. The tetravalent MP0274 molecule contains one DARPin each to target domain I and IV of HER2, respectively, as well as two human serum albumin-binding domains for half-life extension (n.d.bc). Like IgGbased anti-HER2 bpAbs, MP0274 crosslinks HER2 receptors, resulting in comparable antitumor activity to the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab in various HER2-positive cell lines and mouse models. MP0274 may, however, exhibit a unique MoA by stabilizing the AKT-regulated fork-head transcription factor FOX03a leading to the induction of apoptosis. In a Phase I study in patients with HER2-positive solid tumors, MP0274 showed good exposure and a favorable safety profile (n.d.q). A metastatic breast cancer patient previously treated with both trastuzumab and pertuzumab showed a sustained response to MP0274, establishing clinical proof of concept. Retrospective biomarker analysis revealed this patient to be the only one harboring a HER2-positive, PI3K wild-type genetic signature with the highest dose level, suggesting that patient selection could result in higher response rates given good exposure to MP0274. However, further clinical development of MP0274 has been discontinued for strategic reasons (n.d.bq).\n\n\nAnbenitamab and JSKN003\nAlphamab Oncology has engineered a biparatopic HER2 targeting antibody, anbenitamab (KN026), based on trastuzumab and pertuzumab (n.d.br). Heterodimeric Fc pairing of the respective HCs was achieved by a combination of knobs-into-holes and electrostatic steering mutations. Based on structural elucidation of HER2 interacting residues, a common LC was engineered that can productively pair with both the trastuzumab and the pertuzumab HC, respectively. The resulting bpAb\nanbenitamab showed superior antitumor activity compared to the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab across several tumor cell lines with different HER2 levels and comparable activity in mouse models. Preliminary characterization showed that anbenitamab retains the ADCC and antibodydependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) observed for the parent mAbs while simultaneously binding to the two distinct epitopes of HER2. Anbenitamab entered the clinic in 2018 and showed a good safety profile in patients with advanced metastatic breast cancer that had progressed on at least one prior line of treatment including trastuzumab (n.d.bs). Anbenitamab was well tolerated in a second clinical trial including patients with HER2-expressing advanced gastric cancers and gastroesophageal junction cancers (n.d.bt). Based on promising initial activity, anbenitamab is currently being evaluated in a number of clinical trials, including two registrational studies as second-line treatment for HER2-positive advanced or metastatic gastric cancer (NCT05427383) and first line for HER2- positive recurrent or metastatic breast cancer (NCT05838066), both in combination with chemotherapy. Conjugation of anbenitamab to a topoisomerase I inhibitor afforded the biparatopic anti-HER2 ADC JSKN003, which is currently being evaluated in a first-in-human Phase I study in advanced solid tumors (NCT05494918)(n.d.bd).\n\n\nAdditional HER2-targeted bpAbs\nMBS301, BCD-147, TQB2930, and KM257 are four additional clinical stage anti-HER2 bpAbs based on trastuzumab and pertuzumab (n.d.be). MBS301 combines afucosylated half antibodies of trastuzumab and pertuzumab that are produced separately in an engineered CHO cell line and heterodimerized in vitro using knobs-into-holes mutations (n.d.bu). The removal of fucose from the Fc domain boosts ADCC activity that, in combination with biparatopic targeting, results in robust activity across tumor cell lines with varying HER2 levels as well as in mouse models. A Phase I clinical study (NCT03842085) is currently underway evaluating MBS301 for the treatment of HER2- positive recurrent or metastatic malignant solid tumors.\nBiocad’s BCD-147 employs an asymmetric scFv-Fab format and has been tested in a Phase I study in healthy volunteers (NCT03912441)(n.d.bf). Similar in architecture, TQB2930 is developed by Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical and is being investigated for use in HER2-positive solid tumors as a naked antibody (NCT05380882) and as an ADC (TQB2102) in HER2-positive breast cancer and gastric cancer (NCT06115902)(n.d.bg). Finally, Xuanzhu Biopharm is developing the asymmetric common LC bpAb KM257 that is being clinically investigated for the use in HER2-positive solid tumors (NCT05320874) and as an ADC (KM501) in HER2-positive advanced solid tumors (NCT05804864). 70\n\n\nSAR441236\nThe identification and development of effective bnAbs for HIV has been challenging due to high viral genetic diversity (n.d.ax). Large- and small-molecule single-agent therapies have largely failed as the selective pressure increases the chances for mutational escape variants. Preclinical and clinical research using combinations of bnAbs have shown increased efficacy, demonstrating the utility of targeting\nmultiple epitopes (n.d.ax).,85 SAR441236, which is in Phase I clinical development by Sanofi (NCT03705169), consists of a dual specificity cross-over dual variable Ig-like (CODV-Ig) arm paired with a Fab arm with a third, unique specificity, making it a triparatopic bnAb (n.d.ay). Preclinical in vivo data suggest that a triparatopic bnAb is more effective at reducing viral load and prevention of infection in a non-human primate (NHP) simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) viral challenge model (n.d.bv).\n\n\nGEN3009\nGenmab combined their proprietary DuoBody and HexaBody technologies to engineer GEN3009, a CD37 targeting bpAb with enhanced Fc-mediated hexamerization (n.d.n). This bpAb contains complementary Fc mutations that guide heterodimerization in a controlled Fab-arm exchange reaction in vitro and enhanced hexamerization via the E (430?)G mutation. The local increase in Fc domain density due to dual epitope targeting combined with enhanced hexamerization resulted in superior CDC compared to the single parent mAbs or combinations both in B cell lymphoma cell lines as well as in patient-derived chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples. Fc domain clustering further increased both ADCC and ADCP, resulting in potent antitumor activity in several cell line-derived xenograft models as well as in patient-derived non-Hodgkin lymphoma xenografts. GEN3009 has been investigated in a first in human trial in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NCT04358458) but further clinical development was recently discontinued for strategic reasons.\n\n\nREGN5093 and REGN5093-M114\nRegeneron’s biparatopic anti-MET common LC antibody, REGN5093, has progressed into the clinic as both an antibody (NCT04077099) and as an ADC (NCT04982224). Derived from Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune platform, REGN5093 effectively inhibits ligand-independent MET and HGF-induced signaling (n.d.m). DaSilva et al. showed that REGN5093 creates antibody-receptor complexes with a 2:2 stoichiometry, in contrast to monospecific antibodies, which create 1:2 complexes (n.d.m). These larger complexes likely lead to the MET degradation seen with REGN5093 as a product of decreased recycling efficiency and enhanced lysosomal trafficking of the bpAb:receptor complex (n.d.au).,87 Regeneron further exploited this feature of REGN5093 by conjugating a proprietary cytotoxic maytansinoid payload in REGN5093- M114 (n.d.au). This molecule showed efficacy in both METdependent and MET-independent tumor models, further demonstrating the utility of a biparatopic ADC approach.\n\n\nOriCAR-017\nOricell’s biparatopic GPRC5D-targeted CAR-T cell therapy, OriCAR-017, has advanced into the clinic for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (NCT05016778)(n.d.bb). Analogous to cilta-cel, the OriCAR-017 CAR contains tandem sdAbs targeting two distinct epitopes on GPRC5D. The authors speculate that biparatopic targeting increases the specificity and affinity of their CAR-T cell therapy, leading to increased efficacy. Favorable Phase I safety and efficacy data was reported and support further development of OriCAR-017.\n\n\nSARS-CoV-2 neutralizing bpAbs\nThe global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 spurred immense research efforts around the world and multiple groups demonstrated the utility of using antibody fragments such as sdAbs as building blocks for bpAbs (n.d.bw).–90 Several studies showed that bpAbs greatly reduced the prevalence of mutational escape by requiring multiple, simultaneous mutations (n.d.bx).,92 As opposed to monovalent binders, which were typically limited to the traditional blocking MoA by inhibiting the RBD-ACE2 interface, bpAb binding in cis displayed blocking and conformational shifts while biparatopic binding in trans demonstrated blocking and multimerization (n.d.by). The most clinically advanced SARS-CoV -2 targeting bpAb, BAT2022, has completed a Phase I safety and tolerability study (NCT05518695)(n.d.ad). BAT2022 is a symmetric, \\(2 + 2\\) Fc-containing molecule consisting of a sdAb molecule linked to the C-terminus of the HC. BAT2022 maintained its effectiveness as a bnAb against multiple SARS-CoV-2 subvariants, demonstrating utility as a therapeutic antibody. Redundant.\n\n\nISB 1442\nIchnos Sciences’ ISB 1442 is a bispecific bpAb that is based on the proprietary BEAT (n.d.b).0 (Bispecific Engagement by Antibodies based on the TCR) platform (n.d.ab). ISB 1442 binds two distinct CD38 epitopes with high affinity on one tandem Fab arm and combines this with a low affinity CD47 Fab arm to block the signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) on phagocytes. The low CD47 affinity is intended to prevent on-target toxicity on red blood cells while enabling potent antitumor activity when binding avidly guided by the high affinity biparatopic CD38 arm. Combined with Fc mutations to enhance effector function, ISB 1442 not only affects ADCP, but also exhibits ADCC and CDC. Preclinical data suggest that this complex MoA could have increased efficacy and safety as opposed to single target agents. Accordingly, ISB 1442 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical study for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (NCT05427812)(n.d.bz).\n\n\nTNB-738\nAncora Biotech’s TNB-738 is an asymmetric anti-CD38 bpAb consisting of two sdAbs derived from Teneobio’s proprietary transgenic UniRat platform that bind to distinct CD38 epitopes with high affinity (n.d.ai). TNB-738 uses the knobs-into-holes mutations to achieve heavy-chain pairing, a fully silenced IgG4 Fc to eliminate effector functions, and an inert kappa LC and CH1 on one arm to improve manufacturability. Currently in Phase I dose escalation in healthy volunteers (NCT05215912), TNB-738 functions through enzyme inhibition.\n\n\nIMGN151\nImmunogen’s next-generation FRα ADC has progressed into the clinic (NCT05527184) on the heels of their first-generation FRα ADC mirvetuximab-soravtansine, which was granted an accelerated approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2022 (n.d.ba). IMGN151 contains one scFv arm paired with a mirvetuximab Fab arm, each binding unique and non-overlapping epitopes of FRα. The biparatopic targeting mode of IMGN151 boosts binding events on FRα-positive\ncells, resulting in superior payload delivery across high, medium, and low FRα-expressing cell lines. Increased delivery by the bpAb combined with a more potent linker-payload could allow IMGN151 to address a broader patient population than mirvetuximab soravtansine (n.d.aw).\n\n\nConclusion and outlook\nEvolved from combinations of monospecific mAbs, bpAbs have proven their clinical safety and efficacy with the first bpAb-based therapy approved by the FDA in 2022. The bpAbs in the clinical pipeline are based on diverse formats, with no clear trend besides the presence of an Fc domain for stability and effector function. Ultimately, biology dictates the bpAb design. Compared to traditional mAbs, bsAbs, and even mAb combinations that target distinct epitopes, bpAbs offer unique MoAs that make them attractive therapeutics for diverse indications. The avidity enabled by biparatopic binding can enable highly selective tumor targeting, as for the bpAb ISB 1442, characteristics that can also benefit therapeutic modalities such as T cell engagers or CAR-T cells as highlighted by the clinical success of the biparatopic CAR-T therapy cilta-cel. The majority of bpAbs that are currently being tested in the clinic have been shown to affect TAA clustering to improve receptor agonism, effector function, and/or efficient internalization and lysosomal trafficking. In addition to therapeutic mAbs, this MoA is particularly well suited to improve cytotoxic payload delivery to tumors as illustrated by the six ADCs that are currently being evaluated in the clinic. Alternatively, biparatopic binding may improve payload delivery by boosting binding events as speculated for IMGN151. In addition to avid binding and receptor clustering, bpAbs have been used for other MoAs, such as dual-pathway inhibition, stimulation of multi-component targets or, as for the example of the anti-CD38 bpAb TNB-738, locking a target in an enzymatically inactive state. In infectious diseases, bpAbs hold the promise of unlocking bnAbs that have increased durability of response, are more broadly effective against a diverse viral landscape, and could greatly limit the emergence of mutational escape variants. The field is moving from biparatopics to triparatopics and beyond to address some of the most challenging human diseases, such as HIV and SARS-CoV-2.\nAs witnessed by the increasing number of bpAbs in the clinic, bpAbs hold tremendous potential for targeted therapy. The current clinical landscape of bpAbs shows a strong concentration of HER2-targeting agents and related MoAs that are dependent on receptor clustering. The prominence of HER2 may be explained by the clinical precedent for combination therapy with trastuzumab and pertuzumab. However, as bpAbs become ever more accessible with new technologies to engineer more complex architectures, we anticipate that the number of bpAb targets and indications will increase substantially. Targets that have previously failed in the clinic with traditional antibodies may become accessible with bpAbs due to their unique MoAs and new targets that are particularly amenable to bpAbs may emerge. As highlighted by SAR441236 and in preclinical studies, triparatopic or higher valency architectures can expand on the effects observed for bpAbs or even unlock new MoAs. Validated by the first approval for a bpAb therapy, the clinical pipeline for\nbpAbs is rapidly expanding and will motivate more research into this unique class of antibodies to fully exploit the potential of bpAbs for targeted therapy.\n\n\nList of abbreviations\n\n\n\nAbbreviation\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nAβ\namyloid beta\n\n\nADC\nantibody-drug conjugate\n\n\nADCC\nantibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity\n\n\nADCP\nantibody dependent cell phagocytosis\n\n\nBCMA\nB-cell maturation antigen\n\n\nbnAb\nbroadly neutralizing antibody\n\n\nbpAb\nbiparatopic antibody\n\n\nCAR\nchimeric antigen receptor\n\n\nCDC\ncomplement-dependent cytotoxicity\n\n\ncilta-cel\nciltacabtagene autoleucel\n\n\nCLEC12A\nC-type lectin domain family (n.d.ad) member A\n\n\nCODV-Ig\ncross-over dual variable Ig-like\n\n\nDARPin\ndesigned ankyrin repeat proteins\n\n\nDR5\ndeath receptor (n.d.e)\n\n\nEGFR\nepidermal growth factor receptor\n\n\nFab\nantigen-binding fragment\n\n\nFc\ncrystallizable fragment\n\n\nFRα\nfolate receptor alpha\n\n\nGPRC5D\nG protein-coupled receptor class C group (n.d.e) member D\n\n\nHER2\nhuman epidermal growth factor receptor (n.d.b)\n\n\nHIV\nhuman immunodeficiency virus\n\n\nide-cel\nIdecabtagene vicleucel\n\n\nIgG\nimmunoglobulin G\n\n\nIL\ninterleukin\n\n\nLRP6\nlow-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (n.d.f)\n\n\nMET\nmesenchymal epithelial transition factor\n\n\nMoA\nmechanisms of action\n\n\nmAb\nmonoclonal antibody\n\n\nNK\nnatural killer cells\n\n\nNHP\nnon-human primate\n\n\nRBD\nreceptor-binding domain\n\n\nsdAb\nsingle-domain antibody\n\n\nSARS-CoV-2\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (n.d.b)\n\n\nscFv\nsingle-chain Fv fragment\n\n\nSHIV\nsimian-human immunodeficiency virus\n\n\nTAA\ntumor-associated antigen\n\n\nTNFRSF\ntumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily.\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\n\nFunding\nThe author(s) reported there is no funding associated with the work featured in this article.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nn.d.a.\n\n\n———. n.d.b.\n\n\n———. n.d.c.\n\n\n———. n.d.d.\n\n\n———. n.d.e.\n\n\n———. n.d.f.\n\n\n———. n.d.s.\n\n\n———. n.d.g.\n\n\n———. n.d.h.\n\n\n———. n.d.i.\n\n\n———. n.d.j.\n\n\n———. n.d.ad.\n\n\n———. n.d.k.\n\n\n———. n.d.l.\n\n\n———. n.d.m.\n\n\n———. n.d.n.\n\n\n———. n.d.o.\n\n\n———. n.d.br.\n\n\n———. n.d.ab.\n\n\n———. n.d.ay.\n\n\n———. n.d.p.\n\n\n———. n.d.ai.\n\n\n———. n.d.q.\n\n\n———. n.d.r.\n\n\n———. n.d.t.\n\n\n———. n.d.u.\n\n\n———. n.d.v.\n\n\n———. n.d.w.\n\n\n———. n.d.x.\n\n\n———. n.d.y.\n\n\n———. n.d.z.\n\n\n———. n.d.aa.\n\n\n———. n.d.ac.\n\n\n———. n.d.ae.\n\n\n———. n.d.af.\n\n\n———. n.d.ag.\n\n\n———. n.d.ah.\n\n\n———. n.d.aj.\n\n\n———. n.d.ak.\n\n\n———. n.d.al.\n\n\n———. n.d.am.\n\n\n———. n.d.an.\n\n\n———. n.d.ao.\n\n\n———. n.d.ap.\n\n\n———. n.d.aq.\n\n\n———. n.d.ar.\n\n\n———. n.d.as.\n\n\n———. n.d.at.\n\n\n———. n.d.au.\n\n\n———. n.d.av.\n\n\n———. n.d.aw.\n\n\n———. n.d.ax.\n\n\n———. n.d.az.\n\n\n———. n.d.ba.\n\n\n———. n.d.bb.\n\n\n———. n.d.bz.\n\n\n———. n.d.bc.\n\n\n———. n.d.bd.\n\n\n———. n.d.be.\n\n\n———. n.d.bf.\n\n\n———. n.d.bg.\n\n\n———. n.d.bh.\n\n\n———. n.d.bi.\n\n\n———. n.d.bj.\n\n\n———. n.d.bk.\n\n\n———. n.d.bl.\n\n\n———. n.d.bm.\n\n\n———. n.d.bn.\n\n\n———. n.d.bo.\n\n\n———. n.d.bp.\n\n\n———. n.d.bq.\n\n\n———. n.d.bs.\n\n\n———. n.d.bt.\n\n\n———. n.d.bu.\n\n\n———. n.d.bv.\n\n\n———. n.d.bw.\n\n\n———. n.d.bx.\n\n\n———. n.d.by."
